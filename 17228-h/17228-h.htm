<h2><a name="Prefis" id="Prefis"></a>PREFIS,</h2>
<p class="cen">OR<br />
INTERDUCTRY CHAPTER.</p>
<p>There is a vacancy in the mind uv the public for jist sich a
book ez this, else it had never bin published. There is a vacancy
in my pockit for the money I am to reseeve ez copy-rite, else I hed
never slung together, in consecootive shape, the ijees wich I hev
from time to time flung out thro the public press, for the
enlitenment uv an ongrateful public and the guidance uv an obtoose
Dimocracy.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t put these thots uv mine upon paper for
amoozement. There hezn&rsquo;t bin anythin amoozin in Dimocrisy for
the past five years, and the standard-bearers, the captins uv
fifties and hundreds, the leaders uv the hosts, hev hed a ruther
rough time uv it. Our prominence made us uncomfortable, for we hev
bin the mark uv every writer, every orator, ez <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page8" name="page8"></a>8</span>well ez uv every
egg-thrower, in the country. When that gileless patriot, Jeems
Bookannon, retired to private life, regretted by all who held
office under him, Dimocracy felt that she wuz entrin upon a period
uv darknis and gloom. The effort our Suthern brethrin made for
their rites, rendered the position uv us Northern Dimocrats
eggstremely precarious. We coodent go back on our friends South,
for, knowin that peace must come, and that when it did come we wood
hev to, ez in the olden time, look to them for support and
maintenance, it behooved us to keep on their good side. This wood
hev bin easy enuff, but alars! there are laws agin treason, and
two-thirds uv the misguided people north hed got into a way uv
thinkin that the Dimocrasy South had committed that crime, and they
intimated that ef we overstepped the line that divides loyalty from
treason by so much ez the millionth part uv a hair, they&rsquo;d
make us suffer the penalty they hoped to mete out to them, but
wich, owin to Johnson, they dident, and wat&rsquo;s more,
can&rsquo;t. Halleloogy!</p>
<p>But I anticipate. Twict I wuz drafted into a service I
detested&mdash;twict I wuz torn from the buzzum uv my family, wich
I wuz gittin along well enough, even ef the wife uv my buzzum wood
occasionally git obstinit, and refooze to give me sich washin
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page9" name="page9"></a>9</span>money
ez wuz nessary to my existence, preferrin to squander it upon bread
and clothes for the children,&mdash;twict, I say, I wuz pulled into
the servis, and twict I wuz forced to desert to the Dimocrisy uv
the south, rather than fite agin em. When finally the thumb uv my
left hand wuz acksidentally shot off, owin to my foot becomin
entangled into the lock uv my gun, wich thumb wuz also accidentally
across the muzzle thereof, and I wuz no longer liable to military
dooty and cood bid Provost Marshels defiance, I only steered clear
uv Scylla to go bumpin onto Charybdis. I coodent let Dimocrisy
alone, and the eggins&mdash;the ridin upon rails&mdash;the takin uv
the oath&mdash;but why shood I harrow up the public buzzum? I stood
it all till one nite I wuz pulled out uv bed, compelled to kneel
onto my bare knees in the cold snow, the extremity uv my under
garment, wich modesty forbids me to menshun the name uv it,
fluttrin in a Janooary wind, and by a crowd uv laffin soljers
compelled to take the oath and drink a pint uv raw, undilooted
water! That feather broke the back uv the camel. The oath give me
inflamashen uv the brane and the water inflamashen uv the stumick,
and for six long weeks I lay, a wreck uv my former self. Ez I arose
from that bed and saw in a glass the remains uv my pensive beauty,
I vowed to wage <span class="pagenum"><a id="page10" name=
"page10"></a>10</span>a unceasin war on the party wich caused sich
havoc, and I hev kept my oath.</p>
<p>I hev bin in the Apossel biznis more extensively than any man
sence the time uv Paul. First I established a church uv Democrats
in a little oasis I diskivered in the ablishn state uv Ohio, to
wit, at Wingert&rsquo;s Corners, where ther wuz four groceries, but
nary church or skool-house within four miles, and whose populashen
wuz unanimously Dimocratic, the grocery keepers hevin mortgages on
all the land around em&mdash;but alars! I wuz forced to leeve it
after the election of Linkin in 1864. Noo Gersey bein the only
state North wich wuz onsquelched, to her I fled, and at
Saint&rsquo;s Rest (wich is in Noo Gersey) I erected another
tabernacle. There I stayed, and et and drank and wuz merry, but
Ablishnism pursood me thither, and in the fall uv &rsquo;65 that
state got ornery and cussid, and went Ablishn, and agin, like the
wandrin Jew, I wuz forced to pull up, and wend my weary way to
Kentucky, where, at Confedrit &times; Roads, I feel that I am safe.
Massychoosets ideas can&rsquo;t penetrate us here. The aristocracy
bleeve in freedom uv speech, but they desire to exercise a
supervision over it, that they may not be led astray. They bleeve
they&rsquo;r rite, and for fear they&rsquo;d be forced to change
their <span class="pagenum"><a id="page11" name=
"page11"></a>11</span>minds, whenever they git into argument with
anybody, ef the individooal gits the better uv them, they to-wunst
shoot him ez a disturber. Hence Massychoosits can&rsquo;t disturb
us here; the populashen is unanimously Democratic, and bids fair to
continyoo so.</p>
<p>Here I hope to spend the few remainin years uv a eventful life.
Here in the enjoyment uv that end uv the hopes uv all Democrats, a
Post Offis, with four well-regulated groceries within a
stun&rsquo;s throw, and a distillery ornamentin the landscape only
a quarter uv a mile from where I rite these lines, with the ruins
uv a burnt nigger school house within site uv my winder, from wich
rises the odor, grateful to a Democratic nostril, and wich he kin
snuff afar off, and say ha! ha! to, uv a half dozen niggers wich
wuz consumed when it wuz burned, wat more kin I want? I feel that I
am more than repaid for all my suffrins, and that I shel sale
smoothly down the stream uv time, unvexed and happy.</p>
<p>It is proper to state that the papers uv which this volume is
composed wuz written at various times and under various
circumstances. They reflect the mind uv the author doorin a most
eventful year in his history, and mark the condition uv the
Dimocrisy from week to week. Consekently they shift from
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page12" name=
"page12"></a>12</span>grave to gay, from lively to severe, with
much alacrity, the grate party seemin at times to be lifted onto
the top wave uv success, and at other times bein down in the trough
uv despondency and despair.</p>
<p>I mite say more, but wherefore? Ez the record uv a year uv hopes
and fears, uv exaltation and depression, it may possess interest or
may not&mdash;&lsquo;cordin to the style uv the reader. Whatever
may be its fate, one thing I am certin uv, to wit: I am a reglerly
commissioned P.M.; and while the approval of the public mite
lighten the toils uv offishl life and sweeten the whisky wich the
salary purchases, the frowns uv the said public can&rsquo;t redoose
me to the walks uv private life. They can&rsquo;t frown me out uv
offis, nor frown P.M. General Randall&rsquo;s name off my
commishn.</p>

<p class="address"><span class="sc">Saint&rsquo;s Rest</span><br />
(wich is in the State uv Noo Gersey),<br />
November, 9, 1865.</p>
<p>Never wuz I in so pleasant a frame uv mind as last night. All
wuz peace with me, for after bein buffeted about the world for
three skore years, at last it seemed to me ez tho forchune, tired
uv persekootin a unforchnit bein, hed taken me into favor. I hed a
solemn promise from the Demekratic State Central Committy in the
great State uv Noo Gersey, that ez soon ez our candidate for
Governor wuz dooly elected, I shood hev the position uv Dorekeeper
to the House uv the Lord (wich in this State means the Capital,
&amp; wich is certainly better than dwellin in the tents uv wicked
grosery keepers, on tick, ez I do), and a joodishus exhibition uv
this <span class="pagenum"><a id="page14" name=
"page14"></a>14</span>promise hed prokoored for me unlimited
facilities for borrerin, wich I improved, muchly.</p>
<p>On Wednesday nite I wuz a sittin in my room, a enjoyin the
pleasin reflection that in a few days I should be placed above want
&amp; beyond the contingencies uv fortune. Wood! oh wood! that I
hed died then and there, before that dream ov bliss wuz roodly
broken. A wicked boy cum runnin past with a paper wich he hed brot
from the next town where there lives a man who takes one. He flung
it thro the window to me and past on. I opened it eagerly, and
glanced at the hed lines!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;NOO GERSEY&mdash;5,000 REPUBLIKIN!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One long and piercin shreek wuz heard thro that house, and wen
the inmates rushed into the room they found me inanymate on the
floor. The fatal paper lay near me, explainin the cause uv the
catastrophe. The kind-hearted landlord, after feelin uv my pockets
and diskiverin that the contents thereof wood not pay the
arrearages uv board, held a hurried consultation with his wife as
to the propriety uv bringin me to; he insisting that it wuz the
only chance uv gittin what wuz back&mdash;she insistin that ef I
was brung to I&rsquo;d go on runnin up the bill, bigger and bigger,
and never pay at last. While they <span class="pagenum"><a id=
"page15" name="page15"></a>15</span>was argooin the matter, pro and
con, I happened to git a good smell uv his breath, wich restored me
to consciousniss to-wunst, without further assistance.</p>
<p>When in trouble my poetic sole alluz finds vent in song. Did
ever poet who delited in tombs, and dark, rollin streams, and
consumption, and blighted hopes, and decay, and sich themes, ever
hev such a pick of subjects ez I hev at this time? The follerin may
be a consolation to the few Dimokrats uv the North who have gone so
far into copperheadism that they can&rsquo;t change their
base:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A WALE!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the mornin we go forth rejoicin in our strength&mdash;in the
evenin we are bustid and wilt!</p>
<p>Man born uv woman (and most men are) is uv few days, &amp; them
is so full uv trouble that it&rsquo;s skarsely worth while bein
born at all.</p>
<p>In October I waded in woe knee-deep, and now the waters uv
afflickshun are about my chin.</p>
<p>I look to the east, and Massychusets rolls in Ablishun.</p>
<p>To the west I turn my eyes, and Wisconsin, and Minnesota, and
Illinoy ansers Ablishun.</p>
<p>Southward I turn my implorin gaze, and Maryland sends
greetin&mdash;Ablishun. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page16" name=
"page16"></a>16</span>In New York we had em, for lo! we run a
soljer, who fought valiantly, and we put him on a platform, wich
stunk with nigger&mdash;yea, the savor thereof wuz louder than the
Ablishun platform itself.</p>
<p>But behold! the people jeer and flout, and say &ldquo;the
platform stinketh loud enough, but the smell thereof is
<em>not</em> the smell uv the Afrikin&mdash;it is of the rotten
material uv wich it is composed, and the corrupshun they hev placed
upon it&rdquo;&mdash;and New York goes Ablishun.</p>
<p>Slocum held hisself up, and sed, &ldquo;Come and buy.&rdquo; And
our folks bought him and his tribe, but he getteth not his
price.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Noo Gersey&mdash;Ablishun</span>!!</p>
<p>Job&rsquo;s cattle wuz slain by murrain and holler horn and
sich, and, not livin near Noo York, the flesh thereof he cood not
sell.</p>
<p>But Job hed suthin left&mdash;still cood he sell the hides and
tallow!</p>
<p>Lazarus hed sores, but he hed dorgs to lick them.</p>
<p>Noo Gersey wuz the hide &amp; tallow uv the Dimocrisy, and lo!
that is gone.</p>
<p>What little is left uv the Dimocrisy is all sore, but where is
the dorg so low as to lick it!</p>
<p>Noo Gersey wuz our ewe lamb&mdash;lo! the strong hand uv
Ablishnism hez taken it.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page17" name=
"page17"></a>17</span>Noo Gersey wuz the Aryrat on wich our ark
rested&mdash;behold! the dark waves uv Ablishnism sweep over
it!</p>
<p>Darkness falls over me like a pall&mdash;the shadder uv woe
encompasseth me.</p>
<p>Down my furrowed cheeks rolleth the tears uv anguish, varyin in
size from a large Pea to a small tater.</p>
<p>Noo Gersey will vote for the Constooshnel Amendment, and lo! the
Nigger will possess the land.</p>
<p>I see horrid visions!</p>
<p>On the Camden and Amboy, nigger brakesmen; and at the polls,
niggers!</p>
<p>Where shall we find refuge?</p>
<p>In the North? Lo! it is barred agin us by Ablishnism.</p>
<p>In the South? In their eyes the Northern copperhead findeth no
favor.</p>
<p>In Mexico? There is war there, and we might be drafted.</p>
<p>Who will deliver us? Who will pluck us from the pit into wich we
hev fallen?</p>
<p>Where I shel go the Lord only knows, but my impression is, South
Karliny will be my future home. Wade Hampton is electid Governor,
certin, and in that noble State, one may perhaps preserve
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page18" name=

leaven the whole lump.</p>

<p class="ch_desc">A Conversation with General McStinger, of the
State of Georgia, which is interrupted by a Subjugated Rebel.</p>
<p class="address"><span class="sc">Washington, D.C., Nov. 18,
1865.</span></p>
<p>Sence the November elections I hev bin spendin&rsquo; the heft
uv my time in Washinton. I find a melankoly pleasure in
ling&rsquo;rin around the scene uv so many Demokratic triumphs.
Here it wuz that Brooks, the heroic, bludgeoned Sumner; here it wuz
that Calhoon, &amp; Yancey, and Breckinridge achieved their glory
and renown. Besides, it&rsquo;s the easiest place to dodge a board
bill in the Yoonited States. There&rsquo;s so many Congressmen here
who resemble me, that I hev no difficulty in passin for one,
two-thirds uv the time.</p>
<p>Yesterday I met, in the readin-room uv Willard&rsquo;s, Ginral
MacStinger, of South Karliny. The Ginral is here on the same
bizness most uv the Southern men hev in this classic city, that uv
prokoorin a pardon, wich he hed prokoored, and wuz gittin
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page20" name=
"page20"></a>20</span>ready to go home and accept the nominashen
for Congress in his deestrick.</p>
<p>The Ginral wuz gloomy. Things didn&rsquo;t soot him, he
observed, and he wuz afeerd that the country wuz on the high road
to rooin. He hed bin absent from the Yoonited States suthin over
four yeers, wich time he hed spent in the southern confederacy.
When he went out the Constooshnel Dimocrisy hed some rites wich wuz
respected. On his return wat did he see? The power in the hands uv
Radikals, Ablishnism in the majority everywhere, a ex-tailor
President,&mdash;a state uv affairs disgustin in the extreme to the
highly sensitive Southern mind. He had accepted a pardon only becoz
he felt hisself constrained to put hisself in2 position to go to
Congress, that the country might be reskood from its impendin
peril. He shood go to Congress, and then he should ask the despots
who now hev control, whether,&mdash;</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>They spozed the South wood submit to hoomiliatin condishns?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What Androo Johnson means by dictatin to the Convenshuns uv
sovereign States?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; sez he, &ldquo;but a few days ago this boor
hed the ashoorence to write to the Georgy Convenshun that it
&lsquo;<em>must not</em>&rsquo;&mdash;mark the
term&mdash;&lsquo;<span class="sc">must not</span><span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page21" name="page21"></a>21</span> assoom the
confedrit war debt.&rsquo; Is a tailor to say &lsquo;<em>must
not</em>&rsquo; to shivelrus Georgy? Good God!&mdash;where are we
driftin? For one, I never will be consilliated on them
terms&mdash;never! I never wuz used to that style uv talk in
Dimekratic convenshuns.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ez soon ez I take my seet in Congris,&rdquo; resoomed he,
&ldquo;I shel deliver a speech, wich I writ the day after Lee
surrendered, so ez to hev it ready, in which I shel take the
follerin ground, to wit:</p>
<p>&ldquo;That the South hev buried the hatchit, and hev diskivered
that they love the old Yoonion above eny thing on earth. But,</p>
<p>&ldquo;The North must meet us half way, or we wont be answerable
for the consekences. Ez a basis for a settlement, I shell insist on
the follerin condishens:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Federal debt must be repoodiated, principal and
interest, or ef paid, the Southern war debt must be paid
likewise&mdash;ez a peece offerin. The doctrine uv State Rites must
be made the soopreme law uv the land, that the South may withdraw
whenever they feel theirselves dissatisfied with Massachusetts. Uv
coarse this is a olive branch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jefferson Davis must be to-wunst set at liberty and
Sumner hung, ez proof that the North is really <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page22" name="page22"></a>22</span>consilliatory.
On this pint I am inflexible, and on the others
immovable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>An old man who hed bin listnin to our talk, murmured that there
wuz a parallel to this last proposishen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where?&rdquo; demanded the Genral.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Jews, I remember,&rdquo; replied he, &ldquo;demanded
that Barrabas be released unto them, who wuz a thief, I believe,
and the Savior be crucified, but I forgit jist how it
wuz.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Genral withered him with a litenin glance, and resoomed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shel, uv course, offer the North suthin in the way uv
compensation, for the troo theory uv a Republikin Government is
compermise. On our part we pledge ourselves to kum back, and give
the North the benefit uv our kumin back, so long ez Massachusetts
condux herself akkordin to our ijees uv what is rite. But ef this
ekitable adjustment is rejected, all I hev to say then is, I shell
resign, and the Government may sink without wun effort from me to
save it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I wuz about to give in my experience, when the old man, who wuz
sittin near us, broke in agin:</p>
<p>&ldquo;My name,&rdquo; sed he, &ldquo;is Maginnis, and I live in
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page23" name=
"page23"></a>23</span>Alabama. I want to say a word to the
gentleman from Karliny, and to the wun from Noo Gersey.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How,&rdquo; retorted I, &ldquo;do yoo know I&rsquo;m from
Noo Gersey, not hevin spoken a word in yoor hearin?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By a instink I hev. Whenever I see a Sutherner layin it
down heavy to a indivijouel whose phisynogamy is uv sich a cast
that upon beholdin it yoo instinktively feel to see that yoor
pocket-handkercher is safe, a face that wood be dangerous if it had
courage into it, I alluz know the latter to be a Northern
copperhead. The Noo Gersey part I guessed at, becoz, my friend,
that State furnished the lowest order uv copperheads of any uv em.
Pardon me ef I flatter yoo. But what I wanted to say wus, that I
spose suthen hez happened doorin the past 4 years. I was a original
secessionist. Sum years ago I hed a hundred niggers, and wuz doin
well with em. But, unforchunitly, my brother died, and left me ez
much more land, but no niggers. I wanted niggers enuff to work that
land, and spozed ef cut off from the North, and the slave-trade wuz
reopened, I cood git em cheaper. Hentz I seceshed. Sich men ez
Genral McStinger told me the North woodent fight or I woodent hev,
secesht, but I did it. I went out for wool and cum back shorn. I
seceshed with 100 niggers to git 200, and <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page24" name="page24"></a>24</span>alas! I find
myself back into the old government, with nary a nigger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But all this is no excoose for talkin bald noncents. Yoo
old ass,&rdquo; sed he, addressin Genral McStinger, &ldquo;yoo talk
uv wat yoo will do, and what yoo wont. Hevent you diskivered that
yoo are whipped? Hevent you found out that yoo are subjoogated? Are
yoo back into the Yoonyun uv your own free will and akkord? Hevent
yoo got a pardon in yoor pockit, which dockyment is all that saves
yoor neck from stretchin hemp? Why do yoo talk uv wat South karliny
will and wont do? Good Lord! I recollect about a year since South
karliny would <em>never</em> permit her soil 2 be pollutid by
Yankee hirelins, yit Sherman marched all over it with a few uv em,
and skarcly a gun was fired at em. So too I recollect that that sed
State, wich wuz agoin to whip the entire North, and wich wood, ef
overpowered, submit gracefully and with dignity to annihilation,
and sich, wuz the first to, git down on her marrow bones, and beg
for peace like a dorg. Ef yoo intend this talk for the purpose uv
skarin the North, beleeve me when I say that the North aint so easy
skared ez it wuz. Ef its intendid for home consumption, consider me
the people. Ive heard it before, and I&rsquo;ll take no more uv it
until my <span class="pagenum"><a id="page25" name=
"page25"></a>25</span>stumick settles. It makes me puke. The fact
is we are whipped, and hev got to do the best we kin. We are a goin
to pay the Federal debt, and aint goin to pay the confederet debt.
Davis will be hung, and serve him rite. States rites is dead, and
slavery is abolished, and with it shivelry; and its my opinion the
South is a d&mdash;&mdash;d sight better off without either of em.
I kin sware, now, after livin outside uv the shadder uv the flag 4
yeres, that I love it! You bet I do. I carry a small one in my coat
pocket. I hev a middlin sized one waved by my youngest boy over the
family when at prayers, and a whalin big one wavin over my house
all the time. I hev diskivered that its a good thing to live under,
and when sich cusses as yoo talk uv what yoo will and wont do under
it, I bile. Go home, yoo cusses, go home! Yoo, South, and pullin
orf your coat, go to work, thankin God that Johnson&rsquo;s
merciful enuff to let yoo go home at all insted uv hangin yoo up
like a dorg, for tryin to bust a Guverment too good for yoo. Yoo,
North, thankful that the men uv sense uv the North hed the manhood
to prevent us from rooinin ourselves by makin sich ez yoo our
niggers. Avaunt!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the excited Mr. Maginnis, who is evidently subjoogated,
strode out uv our presence. His intemperit <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page26" name="page26"></a>26</span>talk cast a
chill over our confidencis, and we dident resoom with the ease and
freedom we commenced with, and in a few minutes we parted. I
didn&rsquo;t like him.</p>

<p class="ch_desc">A Remarkable Dream.&mdash;A Country settled
exclusively by Democrats.</p>
<p class="address"><span class="sc">Washington</span>, December 1,
1865.</p>
<p>Last nite I was the victim uv another dream. Ef I don&rsquo;t
quit this explorin the realms of the fucher in my sleep, I shall
become a second Saint John. Ef so, I maik no doubt my revelations
will be uv a remarkably startlin character.</p>
<p>Methawt the Ablishnists had asserted the power we diskivered
they possest, after the late elecshuns, and had gone the whole
figger. They had forced the South into the humiliashen uv allowin
niggers to testify, and in the Northern states had given em the
elective franchise. Uv course the edecated and refined democrasy
wood never consent to be carried up to the polls alongside uv a
nigger&mdash;uv course no Democratic offis-seeker wood hoomiliate
himself to treatin a nigger afore a election, it bein a article uv
faith with us never to drink with a nigger, onless he pays for
it.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page28" name=
"page28"></a>28</span>Therefore, bein helpless, and resolvin never
to submit, the heft uv the Democrasy determined to emigrate in a
body to some land where the Anglo-Sackson cood rool,&mdash;where
there was no mixter of the disgustin African. Mexico wuz the
country chosen, and methawt the entire party, in one solid column,
marched there. Our departure was a ovation. The peeple on our route
wuz all dressed in white, ez a token uv joy, and from every house
hung banners, with inscriptions onto em, sich ez,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now is our hen-roosts safe!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Canada on its way to Mexico!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor Mexico&mdash;we bewail thy fate!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Our march resembled very much that uv the childern uv Isrel. Our
noses wuz the pillers uv fire by nite, and our breath the piller uv
smoke by day.</p>
<p>On our arrival to Mexico, the natives of that country, struck
probably with awe at the majestic and flamin expression uv our
countenances, hastily gathered up their linen, and silver spoons,
and hosses, and sich, and retreated to the mountains. It wuz a
kompliment to us that them ez hadn&rsquo;t ennything remained.</p>
<p>Finally we reached a plain, where we, the modern childern uv
Isrel, decided to remane, and, uv course, the fust thing to do wuz
to form a guvernment.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page29" name=
"page29"></a>29</span>Methawt Fernandy Wood, uv New York, wuz
chosen viva voce, ez President, and he stept forerd to hev the oath
administered to him, wich wuz 2 be dun by the oldest Justis uv the
Peece uv the late stait uv Noo Gersey, wich hez committed sooicide.
Here a new trouble ensood&mdash;there wuzn&rsquo;t a bible to be
found in the whole encampment. The difficulty wuz got over by a New
York Alderman yellin out, &ldquo;Never mind the oath. What&rsquo;s
the yoose uv any oath <em>he</em> takes?&rdquo; So he wuz declared
President.</p>
<p>Prest. Wood then proceeded to organize. He requested sich ez hed
held commissions in the army uv the Yoonited States to step forerd
three paces. Gens. Micklelan, Buel, Fitsjohn Porter, &amp; Slocum
stept forerd, and with em some 4,000, a part uv whom hed held
quartermasters&rsquo; commissions, and whose accounts,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Jest afore the battle, mother,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>didn&rsquo;t balance, but wich alluz did jist after, and others
who hed bin dismist for bein in the rear, when their sooperiors
desired to see em in the front, and who consekently considered it a
d&mdash;&mdash;d Ablishun war, wich they didn&rsquo;t approve uv no
how.</p>
<p>Then hevin ascertained the material for officerin his army, he
axed all them who bed bin in the <span class="pagenum"><a id=
"page30" name="page30"></a>30</span>service as privates to step
forerd. 20,000 obeyed, and the President asked the fust one where
he enlisted, who ansered ez follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;At Noo York, April 12, 1864, bounty $1,000;<br />
and at Philadelphia, April 14, 1864, bounty $700;<br />
and at Pittsburgh, April 16, 1864, bounty $800;<br />
and at Cincernati, April 19, 1864, bounty $400;<br />
and at&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Enough,&rdquo; said Fernandy, and glancin down the line,
and seein all the faces were uv the same style and expression, he
asked no more uv em any questions.</p>
<p>Remarkin that it wuz well enough to establish a church, he
desired all who were ministers uv the Gospel to step forerd. 21
stept out and desired to explain. They cood not say that they were
just now in full connexion with any church. They hed bin, but their
unconstooshnel Ablishin Synods and conferences hed accoosed em uv
irregularities in hoss tradin, and various other irregularities,
and suspended em, and silenced em and sich, becoz they were
Democrats, but&mdash;</p>
<p>The President shrugged his sholders, and asked all who cood read
to step out. About one-half answered, and then he requestid sich uv
this number ez cood be prevaled upon to accept a small <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page31" name="page31"></a>31</span>office, and who
bleeved theirselves fit, to step out agin, and to my unutterable
horror and consternation, every one but five stepped out ez brisk
ez so many bees. Immejitly there wuz an uproar. Them ez coodent
read swore vociferously that there wuz nothin fair about
<em>that</em> arrangement. They never knowd that a man wuz obliged
to be able to read to hold office in the Democratic party, and
they&rsquo;d never stand that, and they all stepped out.</p>
<p>Finally it wuz decided that a election should be held at some
fucher time.</p>
<p>The next step wuz to divide em up into employments. The
President requested them ez preferred to foller mekanikle
employments to step out: Sum thirty advanced. Them ez preferred
farmin: About fifty stept out. Them ez expected to run small
groceries:</p>
<p>There wuz a sound like the rush uv many waters. Ninety-eight per
cent, uv all&mdash;ceptin the officers and preachers&mdash;sprung
to the front, but when they saw ther strength, their faces turned
white. &ldquo;Good Lord!&rdquo; whispered they; &ldquo;we
can&rsquo;t make a livin out uv the remainin two per cent. and the
officers and preachers!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The mass then demanded a division uv the property, that all mite
start alike, but upon takin a inventory, <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page32" name="page32"></a>32</span>it wuz found
not wuth while to bother about a division.</p>
<p>Then they commenced murmurin, and sed wun to another, &ldquo;Oh
for the flesh pots uv the Egypt we left!&rdquo; &ldquo;I cood, at
hum, live off my Ablishn nabers.&rdquo; &ldquo;There wuz rich men
in our ward, but ez we hed the majority, <em>they</em> paid taxes,
which <em>we</em> spent!&rdquo; &ldquo;Ablishnists is pizen, but it
is well enough to hev enough uv em to tax!&rdquo; and ez wun man,
they resolved to return, and the confusion that resulted from the
breakin up awoke me.</p>
<p>There is onquestionably a moral in the vision. Ez often ez I hev
syed for perpetual Democratic majorities, I hev sumtimes, when our
party wuz successful, and bid fair to be so permanently, wondered
what we would do with the Treasury ef we didn&rsquo;t lose the
offices occasionally, so ez to hev the other party nurse it into
pickin condition for us.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think I shood like to live in a unanimous
Dimocratic community.</p>

December 9, 1865.</p>
<p>Here in the grate Stait uv Kentucky, the last hope uv Democrisy,
I hev pitched my tent, and here I propose to lay these old bones
when Deth, who has a mortgage onto all uv us, shall see fit to
4close. I didn&rsquo;t like to leave Washinton. I luv it for its
memories. Here stands the Capitol where the President makes his
appintments; there is the Post Offis Department, where all the
Postmasters is appinted. Here it was that Jaxon rooled. I hed a
respex for Jaxon. I can&rsquo;t say I luved him, for he never
yoosed us rite. He hated the Whigs ez bad ez we did, but after we
beat em and elevated him to the Presidency, the stealins
didn&rsquo;t come in ez fast ez we expected. Never shel I forgit
the compliment he paid me. Jest after his election I presented
myself afore him with my papers, an applicant <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page34" name="page34"></a>34</span>for a place. He
read em, and scanned me with a critic&rsquo;s eye.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t yoo make yoose uv sich a man ez me?&rdquo;
sez I, inquirinly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certinly,&rdquo; sez he; &ldquo;I kin and alluz hev. Its
sich ez yoo I use to beet the whigs with, and I am continyooally
astonished to see how much work I accomplish with sich dirty tools.
My dear sir,&rdquo; sed he, pintin to the door, &ldquo;when I
realize how many sich cusses ez yoo there is, and how cheap they
kin be bought up, I really tremble for the Republic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t get the office I wantid.</p>
<p>Yet ez much ez I love Washinton, I wuz forced to leave it. I
mite hev stayed there, but the trooth is, the planks uv that city
and the pavements are harder, and worse to sleep on, than those uv
any other city in the Yoonited Staits. I hed lived two months by
passin myself off ez Dimekratic Congressmen, but that cood only
last a short time, there not bein many uv that persuasion here to
personate. I had gone the rounds uv the House ez often ez it wuz
safe, and one nite commenced on the Senit. Goin into
Willard&rsquo;s, I called for a go uv gin, wich the gentlemanly and
urbane bar keeper sot afore me, and I drank. &ldquo;Put it down
with the rest uv mine,&rdquo; sez I, with a impressive wave uv the
hand.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page35" name=
"page35"></a>35</span>&ldquo;Yoor name?&rdquo; sez he.</p>
<p>Assoomin a intellectual look, I retorted, &ldquo;Do you know
Charles Sumner?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="figure"><a href="images/illo_1_big.png"><img src=

<p>DO YOU KNOW CHARLES SUMNER?</p>
</div>
<p>Here I overdid it; here vaultin ambition o&rsquo;er-leaped
herself. Hed I sed &ldquo;Saulsbury,&rdquo; it mite have ansered,
but to give Sumner&rsquo;s name for a drink uv gin wuz a peece uv
lunacy for wich I kan&rsquo;t account. I wuz ignominiously kicked
into the street. Drinks obtained at the expense uv bein kicked is
cheep, but I don&rsquo;t want em on them terms; my pride revolted,
and so I emigrated. The gentlemanly and urbane conductors uv the
Pennsylvania Central passed me over their road. They did it with
the assistance uv two gentlemanly and urbane brakesmen, wich
dropped me tenderly across the track, out uv the hind eend uv the
last car.</p>
<p>I found here a church buildin, uv wich the congregation had bin
mostly killed in bushwhackin expeditions, and announsin myself ez a
constooshnel preacher from Noo Gersey, succeeded in drawin together
a highly respectable awjience last Sunday.</p>
<p>Takin for a text the passage, &ldquo;The wagis uv sin is
death,&rdquo; I opened out ez follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wat is sin? Sin, my beloved hearers, is any deviashen
from yer normal condishen. Yoor beloved pastor hez a stumick and a
head, wich is in <span class="pagenum"><a id="page36" name=
"page36"></a>36</span>close sympathy with each other, so much so,
indeed, that the principal biznis uv the head is to fill the
stumick, and mighty close work its been for many years, yoo bet.
Let yoor beloved pastor drink, uv a nite, a quart or two more than
his yoosual allowance, more than his stumick absolootely demands,
and his head swells with indignashen. The excess is sin, and the
ache is the penalty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The wagis uv sin is death! Punishment and sin is ez
unseperable ez the shadder is from the man&mdash;one is ez shoor to
foller the other ez the assessor is to kum around&mdash;ez nite is
to foller day. The Dimekratic party, uv wich I am a ornament, hez
experienced the trooth uv this text. When Douglas switched off, he
sinned, and ez a consekence, Linkin wuz elected, and the Sceptre
departed from Israel. When&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this pint in the discourse, a old man in the back part uv the
house ariz and interrupted me. He sed he hed a word to say on that
subjick which must be sed, and ef I interrupted him till he got
through he&rsquo;d punch my hed; whereupon I let him go on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Trooly,&rdquo; sez he, &ldquo;the wages of sin is deth. I
hev alluz bin a Dimecrat. The old Dimocracy hez bin in the service
uv sin for thirty years, and <span class="pagenum"><a id="page37"
name="page37"></a>37</span>the assortment uv death it hez received
for wages is trooly surprisin. Never did a party commence better.
Jaxon wus a honist man, who knew that righteousnis wuz the
nashun&rsquo;s best holt. But he died, and a host uv tuppenny
politicians, with his great name for capital, jumped into his old
clothes, an undertook to run the party. Ef the Dimocracy coold hev
elected a honist man every fourth or fifth term, they mite hev
ground along for a longer period, but alars! Jaxon wuz the last of
that style we hed, and so many dishonist cusses wuz then in the
Capital that his ghost coodent watch the half uv them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The fust installment uv deth we reseeved wuz when
Harrison beet us. The old pollytishens in our party didn&rsquo;t
mind it, for, sez they, &lsquo;The Treasurey woodent hev bin wuth
mutch to us ennyhow after the suckin it has experienced for 12
years; it needs 4 years uv rest.&rsquo; We elected Poke, and here
it wuz that Sin got a complete hold uv us. Anshent compacts made
with the devil wuz alluz ritten in blud. We made a contract with
Calhoonism, and that wuz ritten in blud wich wuz shed in Mexico.
Here we sold ourselves out, boots and britches, to the cotton
Democricy, and don&rsquo;t our history ever sence prove the trooth
uv the text, &lsquo;The wages uv <span class="pagenum"><a id=
"page38" name="page38"></a>38</span>sin is deth?&rsquo; O, my
frends! in wat hevy installments, and how regularly, hez these
wages bin pade us.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our men uv character commenst leavin us. Silas Write
kicked out, and wood hev gone over agin us hed he not fortunately
died too soon, and skores uv uthers followed soot. Things went on
until Peerse wuz elected. The Devil (wich is cotton), whom we wuz
servin, brot Kansas into the ring, and wat a skatterin ensood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Agin, the men uv character got out, and gradually but
shoorly the work uv deth went on. Bookannon wuz elected, but wuz uv
no yoose to us. After Peerse hed run the machine four yeers, wat
wuz there left? Eko ansers. Anuther siftin follered, and the old
party wich wunst boasted a Jaxon hed got down to a Vallandigum. The
Devil, to wich we hed sold ourselves, wood not let us off with
this, however. &lsquo;The wages uv sin is deth,&rsquo; and we hed
not reseeved full pay ez yet. He instigated South Karliny to rebel;
he indoosed the other Democratic States to foller; he forced the
Northern Democrisy to support em, and so on. That wuz the final
stroke. Dickinson, and Cass, and Dix, and Todd, and Logan, all left
us, and wun by wun the galaxy uv Northern stars disappeared from
the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page39" name=
"page39"></a>39</span>Democratic firmament, leaving Noo Gersey
alone, and last fall, my brethrin, she sot in gloom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, how true it is! We served sin faithfully, and where
are we? We went to war for slavery, and slavery is dead. We fit for
a confederacy, and the confederacy is dead. We fit for States
Rites, and States Rites is dead. And Democracy tied herself to all
these corpses, and they hev stunk her to death.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kentucky went heavy into the sin biznis, and whar is
Kentucky? We sent our men to the confedrit army, and none uv em cum
back, ceptin the skulkers, who comprised all uv that class wich we
wood hev bin glad to hev killed. Linkin wantid to hev us free our
niggers, and be compensatid for em. We held on to the sin uv
niggers, and now they are taken from us with nary a compensate. In
short, whatever uv good the Devil promised us in pollytix hez
resulted in evil. My niggers is gone, my plantashen here hez fed
alternately both armies, ez they cavorted backerds and forrerds
through the Stait, my house and barns wuz burnt, and all I hev to
show for my property is Confedrit munny, which is a very dead
article uv death. I know not what the venerable old sucker in the
pulpit wuz a goin to say, but ef he kin look over this section uv
the heritage, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page40" name=

text, he aint much on the preach. I&rsquo;m dun.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Uv coarse, after a ebulition of this kind, I cooldn&rsquo;t go
on. I dismist the awdience with a benedickshun, hopin to get em
together when sich prejudiced men aint present.</p>

<p class="address"><span class="sc">Confedrit &times;

(wich is in the Stait uv Kentucky),<br />
December, 20, 1865.</p>
<p>At last! The deed is dun! The tiranikle government which hez
sway at Washington hez finelly extinguished the last glimerin
flicker uv Liberty, by abolishin slavery! The sun didn&rsquo;t go
down in gloom that nite&mdash;the stars didn&rsquo;t fade in2 a
sickly yeller, at wich obstinacy uv nachur I wuz considably
astonished.</p>
<p>I got the news at the Post Offis (near wich I am at present
stayin, at the house uv a venerable old planter, who accepts my
improvin conversation and a occasional promise, wich is cheap, ez
equivalent for board). Sadly I wendid my way to his peaceful home,
dreadin to fling over that house the pall uv despair. After supper
I broke to em ez gently ez I cood the intelligence that
three-fourths uv the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page42" name=
"page42"></a>42</span>States hed ratified the constooshnel
amendment&mdash;that Seward had ishood his proclamation, and that
all the Niggers wuz free!</p>
<p>Never did I see sich sorrer depicted on human
countenance&mdash;never wuz there despair uv sich depth. All nite
long the bereaved inmates uv that wunst happy but now distracted
home wept and waled in agony wich wuz perfectly heart rendin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wo is me,&rdquo; sobbed the old man, wringin his
hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;John Brown&rsquo;s karkis hangs a danglin in the air, but
his sole is marchin on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It took posseshun of Seward, and thro his ugly mouth it
spoke the words &lsquo;the nigger is free,&rsquo; and there is no
more a slave in all the land.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wunst I hed a hundred niggers, and the men were fat and
healthy, and the wenches wuz strong, and sum uv em wuz fair to look
upon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They worked in my house, and my fields, from the rising
uv the sun to the goin down uv the same.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wuz they lazy? I catted them till they wuz cured thereof;
for lo! they wuz ez a child under my care.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did they run away? From Kentucky they run North, and lo!
the Locofoco Marshals caught them for me, and brought them back,
and delivered them <span class="pagenum"><a id="page43" name=
"page43"></a>43</span>into my hand, without cost, sayin, lo! here
is thy nigger&mdash;do with him ez thou wilt (wich I alluz did),
wich is cheeper than keepin dogs, and jest as good.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Solomon wuz wise, for he hed uv konkebines a suffishensy,
but we wuz wiser in our day than him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For he hed to feed his children, and it kost him shekels
uv gold and shekels uv silver, and much corn and oil.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We hed our konkebines with ez great a muchness ez
Solomon, but we sold their children for silver, and gold, and
red-dog paper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And all nite long the bereaved old patriarch, who hed alluz bin
a father to his servants (and a grandfather to menny uv em) poured
out his lamentations.</p>
<p>In the mornin the niggers wuz called up, and ez they all hed
their koats on, and hed bundles, I spect they must hev heard the
news. The old gentleman explained the situation to em.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yoo will,&rdquo; sed he, &ldquo;stay in yoor happy
homes&mdash;you will alluz continue to live here, and work here, ez
yoo hev alluz dun!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The niggers all in korious, with a remarkable unanimity, remarkt
that ef they hed ever bin introdoost to theirselves, they thought
they woodent. In <span class="pagenum"><a id="page44" name=

<p>EFFECT OF THE EMANCIPATION PROCLAMATION IN KENTUCKY.</p>

<p>A paroxysm uv pain and anguish shot over the old man&rsquo;s
face. Nearest to him stood a octoroon, who, hed she not bin tainted
with the accurst blood uv Ham, wood hev bin considered beautiful.
Fallin on her neck, the old patriarch, with teers a streamin down
his furrowd cheeks, ejackilated,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Farewell, Looizer, my daughter, farewell! I loved yoor
mother ez never man loved nigger. She wuz the solace uv my leisure
hours&mdash;the companion uv my yooth. She I sold to pay orf a
mortgage on the place&mdash;she and yoor older sisters. Farewell! I
hed hoped to hev sold yoo this winter (for yoo are still young),
and bought out Jinkins; but wo is me! Curses on the tirent who thus
severs all the tender ties uv nachur. Oh! it is hard for father to
part with child, even when the market&rsquo;s high; but, Oh God! to
part thus&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the old gentleman, in a excess uv greef, swoonded away
genteely.</p>
<p>His son Tom hed bin caressin her two little children, who wuz a
half whiter than she wuz. Unable to restrain hisself, he fell on
her neck, and bemoaned his fate with tetchin pathos.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page45" name=

children! Farewell faro, and hosses, and shampane&mdash;a long

my needs. Hed you died, I cood hev bin resigned; for when dead you
ain&rsquo;t wuth a copper; but to see yoo torn away livin, &amp;
wuth $2,000 in enny market&mdash;it&rsquo;s too much, it&rsquo;s
too much!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he fainted, fallin across the old man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;ll do the work about the house?&rdquo; shreekt
the old lady, faintin and fallin across Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;ll dress us, and wash us, and wait on
us?&rdquo; shreekt the three daughters, swoonding away, and fallin
across the old woman.</p>
<p>My first impulse wuz to faint away myself, and fall across the
three daughters; but I restraned myself, and wuz contented with
strikin a attitood and organizin a tablo. Hustlin the niggers away
with a burnin cuss for their ingratitood, I spent the balance uv
the forenoon in bringin on em too. Wun by wun they became conshus;
but they wuz not theirselves. Their minds wuz evidently shattered;
they wuz carryin a heavy heart in their buzzums.</p>

Faith in the final Triumph of Democracy.</p>
<p class="address"><span class="sc">Confedrit &times;

(wich is in the Stait uv Kentucky),<br />
January 6, 1866.</p>
<p>I see a lite. Democricy is not that dead karkis its enemies
hoped for and its friends feared. My noomerious friends here
insisted that ez I wuz growin into the seer and yaller leaf, I
shood abandon Dimocrisy, and flote with the current. I cant. Ez
troo ez the needle to the pole, so am I to Dimocrisy. Young wimmin
flock to marryins, middle-aged ones to bornins, and old ones to
buryins, which shows concloosively to the most limited intelleck
wat the mind uv each class runs upon. So it is with me. To me
Dimocrisy is wife, mother, and child.</p>
<p>I hev diskivered many things sense I hev bin in
Kentucky&mdash;things wich elevated my deprest heart ez yeast does
dough, wich filled my shrunken soul ez wind does a bladder.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page48" name=
"page48"></a>48</span>The people uv Kentucky wuz all loyal. Doorin
the horrible fratrisidle war wich hez rent the proud temple uv
liberty into twain, they preserved a strict nootrality. I hed a
conversation with wun old patriarch, who asshoored me that he hed
never taken sides.</p>
<p>Upon his honor, he asshoored me that, after battles, he rifled
the corpses uv both armies, impartially. &ldquo;Cood any boddy be
more nootraller than that?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;My sons,&rdquo;
sed he, &ldquo;wuz in the confedrit army. This fact wood hev turned
the affections uv a week-minded man in that direction; but when I
thot uv the boys, I alluz thot also uv that gellorious
star-spangled banner, under wich I hed whipped my niggers and sold
their children; under whose shadder I hed men servants, and made
servants, and home-made servants born unto me. That banner hed bin
my shield. Ef my niggers run off, who so prompt in their pursoot ez
the Democratic marshals, wich alluz returned em to me ef it wuz
possible? The instooshun wuz guaranteed to me by solemn
compermises, wich we cood hev ez often ez we desired. Compermises
wuz our best holt. Whenever we wanted anything, all we hed to do
wuz to ask for it. The Ablishinists wood object, the Dimocrisy wood
draw up a compermise, wich inklooded, <span class="pagenum"><a id=
"page49" name="page49"></a>49</span>ez a rool, twice or 3 times wat
we asked, and pass it to save the Union. Sich a Union wuz worth
havin, and I opposed all efforts to dissolute it. Hed the South
succeeded, I shood hev gone with em; for Kentucky alone&mdash;the
only nigger State in the North&mdash;wood hev bin helpless. Scaldin
tears hev I shed when contemplatin the horrors uv war; but I cood
do nothin to avert it. Kentucky wuz loyal, but nootral.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I find down here that the loyal citizens uv Kentucky who hev
returned from the confedrit service are not at all discouraged; on
the contrary, they are hopeful. Sed one to me (I bleeve he wuz a
Kernel under Gen. Forest; indeed, I think he told me he
participated in the glorious victory at Fort Piller),&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why art thou cast down? Things is workin eggsackly to our
hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a mournful tone, I retorted that I failed to perseeve it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I kin,&rdquo; sez he. &ldquo;Lookye, my venerable friend.
Is the Northern Dimocrisy still troo?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They is,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;wat few remains. But,
alas! war, crool war, hez decimated our ranks five
times.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How so?&rdquo; sez he. &ldquo;None uv your kind uv
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page50" name=
"page50"></a>50</span>Democrats jined in this unholy croosade, and
fell afore our deth-deelin swords&mdash;did they?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not any,&rdquo; sez I; &ldquo;but Kanady and Montana took
em afore each draft. That wuz why we wuz so beet at the eleckshuns.
For one week-kneed Ablishinist we scared into our ranks, we lost
two by emigration; and, unfortunitly, wun half that emigrated
starved to deth, and tother half is distribbited in the various
States prisons in them lands uv refuge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Still,&rdquo; sez he, &ldquo;it matters not. Yoo hev
deestricks yoo kin carry in most uv the States. The Five Points
deestrick, in Noo York, is ours. Noo Gersey will go back to her
allegiance. The new gold States, where so menny uv our friends
fled, will send up Democrats to Congress. Ohio hez 2 devoted to us,
Pennsylvany hez several, and the most uv the Northern States will
send one or two; and them from the North kin be depended on to go
any measure we say. Then&rdquo;&mdash;and he slapped me on the back
highlariously&mdash;&ldquo;the niggers is free!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; sez I, not seem wat cause for highlarity
that wuz.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; sez he, &ldquo;them niggers is not now
<span class="sc">other persons</span>! We alluz counted five uv em
for three in making up the Congressers we wuz entitled to;
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page51" name="page51"></a>51</span>now
they count as white men, wich increases our delegashuns to sich an
extent that ef yoo Northern men do half yoor dooty, we&rsquo;ll hev
a majority in Congress. Then, good Lord! the pleasant crack uv the
whip shel agin be heard on the plains uv the sunny South. The
niggers wont be re-enslaved; but our Legislaters will speedily
redoose em to their normal condishun. We shell observe the
Constitushnel Amendment strickly and in good faith. The Afrikin
shel be free; but the good uv society demands that he shel be under
proper guardianship. He wont be allowed to change his location; and
the laws uv the States will define his dooties, and give us the
power uv enforcin em. He wont be allowed to hev arms, so he
can&rsquo;t resist. Ez he can&rsquo;t leave a plantation, he will
hev to submit quietly to sich rools ez the high-minded planter
makes for him, or be shot on the spot, or turned out to die uv
starvashun, akording to circumstances. Ef the planter is a
unrejenerated child uv damnashun, he will shoot him; ef he is a
saint, who hez a southern hope uv a blessed immortality beyond the
grave, he&rsquo;ll restrane his anger, and turn him out to die uv
hunger, onless he repents, and comes back humble. Then, they bein
free and responsible for theirselves, we ain&rsquo;t obleeged to
take care uv the sick, the aged, or the infirm, so <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page52" name="page52"></a>52</span>it will be
really better than it wuz before. I see a gellorious future afore
us. Thro the thick clouds uv gloom the brite sun uv hope cheerinly
breaks. Say to the Northern Dimocrisy, be uv good cheer. Agin they
shel lick our hands; agin they shel eat the crumbs that fall from
the National table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank God for the Northern Dimocrisy, with the other
blessins He has given the South. With niggers to do our manual
labor for nothing, with Northern Democrats to do our votin at
almost the same price, we are trooly a favored people. Bless the
Lord for the nigger and the Democrat, wich is both useful to us,
each in his speer!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I drew encouragement from his remarks. The deep vane uv pious
thankfulness wich run through his discourse was nateral to him. He
is a trooly pious man, and wuz just back frum the meetin uv the
Synod uv one uv the Southern churches, wich still persists in
quotin Onesimus and Hayger. I feel encouraged. O, Dimmycrats uv the
North, let us</p>

<p>We had sort uv a celebrashun uv the 8th day uv Janooary at the
Corners last nite. My meetin house wuz gorgeously decorated for the

the corners of the pulpit wuz placed two skulls uv Yankees, picked
up at Andersonville by one of the guards, who is now a loyal
citizen uv this State, residin at this pint. These skulls wuz
illuminated by placin a taller candle inside uv each uv em. The
effect wuz inspirin. The guard who contributed em, is, I need not
say, a conservative Democrat, and in the matter uv swearing at
Ablishnists he displays more talent, and hez a more comprehensive
range uv oaths, than any man I ever <span class="pagenum"><a id=

decorated with mottoes, furnished by myself and others, uv wich the
followin is some uv em:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Yoonyun ez it wuz&mdash;under Bookanan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The noble dead uv Kentucky&mdash;them ez fell pintin

<p>&ldquo;Niggers and northern Dimocrisey&mdash;we&rsquo;ve lost

<p>I hevn&rsquo;t time nor space to give, in full, the perceedins
uv the evenin. Suffice it to say, at 12, precisely, the company
broke up, and sich uv em ez were able, departed. I remained. There
wuz suthin in the refreshments wich indoost me to stay; in fact, I
coodn&rsquo;t conveniently get out from under the table, where I
hed fallen.</p>
<p>While peacefully sleepin the sleep uv innosence, my unfettered
sole went orf on a explorin expedishen into the land uv dreams, and
I dreamed.</p>
<p>Methawt that we wuz celebratin the anniversary uv the battle uv
Noo Orleans, on a heavier skale than the wun just closed. We hed,
at our festive board, all the grate lites uv Dimocrisy. There wuz
Fernandy Wood and his brother Ben, and Dan Voorhes, and the grate
Valandigum and Frank <span class="pagenum"><a id="page55" name=
"page55"></a>55</span>Peerce, and Bookanon hed consented to emerge
from his saint-like retirement, and meet with us. The South wuz
represented by sich noble Dimocrats ez Yancy, and Toombs, and
Wigfall; in short, it wuz a reyoonyun uv old-time Dimocrats, met
not only to honor the memry uv Jackson, but to consult ez to the
best method uv savin the yoonyun from the rox uv Abolishun onto
wich it seems now to be driftin.</p>
<p>The gileless Bookanon wuz President uv the evenin, and
Breckinridge Vice President, and toasts wuz drank ez
follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The ancient Dimocrisy&mdash;troo to the country, ez long
ez there is an office to be filled.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Response by Fernandy Wood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The President uv the evenin&mdash;the last Dimocratic
President uv the Yoonited States.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr Bookanan rose to respond, but he wuz overkum, and sank back,
his eyes suffoozed with tears. In a voice broken with emoshun, he
intimated that he wuz in daily expectation uv bein translated, ez
Elijer wuz, in a barouche with two white hosses.
&ldquo;White,&rdquo; he repeated; &ldquo;for ef the team is black,
I won&rsquo;t go; I&rsquo;ll die the nateral way fust.&rdquo;
&ldquo;My frends,&rdquo; sed he, &ldquo;keep my mantle out uv the
hands uv the Jews. Wher is the Elisha who&rsquo;ll wear
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page56" name=
"page56"></a>56</span>&ldquo;The yoonun ez it wuz, the constooshun
ez it is, and the nigger where he ought to be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Response by Breckinridge, who sed he hed bin four years fightin
the battles uv the Dimocrisy, whose prinsiples wuz happily set
forth in the sentiment. Beeten in the field, we must fight it out
at the ballot-box. <em>Nil despritrando</em> must be the motto uv
the Dimocrisy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Androo Jaxon, the&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>As thus much uv the toast wuz read, there wuz a clap uv thunder
heard, wich shook the buildin, and made not only the windows
rattle, but the glasses to dance on the table, and the gost uv
Androo Jaxson hisself, in the uniform uv 1812, come down through
the ceelin. There wuz a frown on his countenance, terrible to
behold. Turnin to the company, he remarked that the gate-keeper uv
hell must hev slept at his post, for out uv no other Depository
cood there be gathered so many villianous countenances. &ldquo;I
perpose,&rdquo; sed he, &ldquo;to respond to this sentiment
myself.&rdquo; The Woods slid out uv their seets, under the table;
Breckinridge sneaked out uv the church; Vallandigham, with his
natural impudence, tried to face it out, but one look from Androo
J. finished him, and he slid, and Bookannon tried <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page57" name="page57"></a>57</span>to git out, but
Androo caught him by the collar, and held him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hev suthin to say to yoo. The chair yoo wunst
disgraced, I okkepied, called to it, ez yoo wuz, by the voice uv
the peeple. I swore to preserve the constitooshen and the yoonyun,
and so did yoo. I did it, and yoo didn&rsquo;t. When South Carliny
undertook to nullify, I bustid the arrangement, becoz I
didn&rsquo;t propose to hev the yoonyun I fought for in two wars go
down to death, when a particle uv pluck, put in at the right time,
cood save it. Yoo mite hev dun the same, but yoo woodent. Yoo took
the seat for the purpose of bustin it; for one term of the
Presidency yoo agreed to destroy the Government.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are yoo here for?&rdquo; shouted the gost in a
terribly sepulkral tone, and a stampin his feet and grittin his
teeth. &ldquo;To celebrate the battle uv Noo Orleans? Yoo stole the
livery uv Jaxon to serve Calhoon in. Under the shadder uv my name,
yoor dooing deeds wich, ef I wuz in the flesh, I&rsquo;d hang yoo
for. How I wished, in &rsquo;60 and &rsquo;61, I cood revisit the
earth. I&rsquo;d hev histed yoo out uv the seat yoo disgraced, and
never hev let Linkin hed the credit uv puttin down a rebellion. It
wood hev bin lively for some uv yoo. I&rsquo;d hev ornamented the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page58" name=

buzzards wood hev grown fat on secesh korpses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go back, yoo idiots&mdash;go back to your first love. Get
the wool out uv your teeth, and try to think more uv your country
than yoo do uv a yaller girl. Yoo kin yit repent. A. Johnson, whose
initials is the same ez mine, runs over with mercy, or he wood hev
hung the half uv yoo. Repent and be saved. There is a slite chance
for yoo yit. The dyin theef wuz pardoned on the cross, wich ought
to be encouragin to yoo, for yoo hev longer time left in wich to
repent, and the Lord knows yoo need it. But ef yoo will go on in

January 27, 1866.</p>
<p>Halleloogy! halleloogy! halleloogy! I see a lite! It beams onto
me! It penetrates me! It fills me! Goy to the world!</p>
<p>I hev diskivered the cause uv the decline uv the Dimocrisy. I
seed it yisterday. I wuz a wanderin on the neighborin hills, a
musin onto the cussednis uv humanity ez exemplified in the person
uv the grocery keeper at the Corners, who unanimusly refoozed to
give me further credit for corn whisky, wich is the article they
yoose in this country to pizen theirselves with. He asshoored me
that he hed the utmost regard for my many virtues; but he
diskivered that the one he prized the most I hedn&rsquo;t so many
uv, to wit, that uv payin for my likker. <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page61" name="page61"></a>61</span>Therefore the
account mite be considered closed. Then, for the fust time in my
life, I bleeved in total depravity.</p>
<p>While musin, in a melonkoly mood, on this dark cloud wich fell
across my pathway, and the fall uv the Dimocratic party, I came
onto a party of men borin for ile. Then the trooth flashed over me.
Their operations showed me the way to success&mdash;the shoor path
to triumph.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When,&rdquo; said I to myself, &ldquo;when men seek gain
they bore for it. They go down&mdash;never up.&rdquo; Even so with
the Dimocrisy. We dug downward, downward, downward, through all the
strata uv society. We went through the groceries; the next stratum
was the most ignorant uv the furiners; then we struck the poor
whites uv the South; then, below them, the heft uv the people uv
Noo Gersy; then Southern Illinoy and Indiana; then Pike county,
Missouri; and so on. We never went upward for converts, cause
&lsquo;twant no use. When a man wanted to jine us he alluz hed to
come down. We got lots of converts.</p>
<p>There was a regular slidin scale, which the heft uv Democrats
who wuznt born in the party hev slid down; to wit:&mdash;</p>
<p>Quarter dollar smiles.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page62" name=
"page62"></a>62</span>15 cent nips.</p>
<p>10 cent drinks.</p>
<p>5 cent sucks.</p>
<p>A flat flask conceeled.</p>
<p>A bottle openly.</p>
<p>Dimocrisy.</p>
<p>We lost our hold for two reasons. First, the poor likker we hev
now kills off our voters too fast; and the tax on whiskey forced
two thirds uv our people to quit suckin, and ez soon ez they begun
to git on their feet they jined the Ablishnists. Secondly, our
leaders spozed there wuz no lower stratum to dig into, and give up
in disgust.</p>
<p>But I hev deskivered that lower stratum&mdash;I hev found it;
and when the idea flashed over my Websterian intelleck, I shouted
Halleloogy! The nigger is the lower stratum; and ef we bore down to
it, and work it thoroughly, we hev, at least, a twenty years&rsquo;
lease uv power.</p>
<p>We must cultivate the nigger. <span class="sc">He must hev the
suffrage</span>! It is a burnin shame, that, in this Nineteenth
Sentry, in the full blaze uv intelligence, livin under a
Deklarashun which declares all men &ldquo;free and ekal,&rdquo;
that a large body uv men shood be denied the glorius privilege uv
bein taken up to the poles and voted. Is not the Afrikin a man? Is
he <span class="pagenum"><a id="page63" name=
"page63"></a>63</span>not taxed ez we are, and more than most uv
the Democrisy, for many uv em own property? Is he not amenable to
all the laws, even ez we is? Then why, I triumphantly ask, is he
not entitled to a vote? Ah! why, indeed?</p>
<p>&ldquo;But this is Ablishnism!&rdquo; methinks I hear a obtoose
Dimocrisy observe in horrer. &ldquo;And why give them votes who
will use em agin us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>My gentle friend, <em>will</em> they use their ballot agin us?
Ef I know myself, I think not. Kin they read? Kin they write? Aint
the bulk uv em rather degraded and low than otherwise? Methinks.
Aint that the kind uv stock we want, and the kind wich hez alluz
set us up? Readin hez alluz bin agin us. Every skool master is a
engine uv Ablishnism; every noosepaper is a cuss. General Wise, uv
Virginia, when he thanked God there wuzn&rsquo;t a noosepaper in
his deestrick, hed reason to; for do yoo spoze a readin
constitooency wood hev ever kept sich a blatherskite ez him in
Congress year after year?</p>
<p>Then, agin, the Constooshnal Amendment will pass, givin
representashen to voters alone. The Democratic States will hev more
members uv Congress and more electoral votes than afore the war;
and them States we kin depend on.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page64" name=
"page64"></a>64</span>But my skeem is still more comprehensive.
Them niggers ain&rsquo;t needed in the South. We&rsquo;ll send em
North. A few thousand will overbalance the Ablishun majority in Noo
Gersey; fifty thousand will bring Ohio back to the fold; the same
number will do for New York and Pennsylvany, and the country is
saved&mdash;we will be able to elect the President. Thus the pit
the Ablishnist dug for us he&rsquo;ll fall into hisself; the club
he cut for us will break his own head.</p>
<p>Honey hez kum out uv the carcass; good hez perceded from
Nazareth. The nigger smells sweeter to me now than Nite bloomin
Serious; he is more precious to me than gold, or silver, or preshus
stones. He is the way, and I shel walk in it. He shel lift me into
a Post orifis. We must give our Afrikin brother,&mdash;for is he
not a man and a brother?&mdash;not only the suffrage, but he must
hev land, and the Democracy must give it to him. I want Garrit
Davis to instantly interdoose a bill into the Senit givin each
family a quarter section uv land, a pair uv mules, and a cook
stove; and each female Afrikin brother two flarin calico dresses
and a red bonnet. I want him to advocate the bill in a speech uv
not more than two hours, so that it will stand some chance uv
passin. On second thought, I guess some <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page65" name="page65"></a>65</span>other man hed
better interdoose the bill, as the Sennit hez got into sich a habit
uv votin down everything he proposes, that they&rsquo;d slather
this without considerin it, on jineral principles.</p>
<p>Then we&rsquo;ve got em. Work ez hard ez they may at it,
it&rsquo;ll take twenty years afore the Ablishinists kin edjukate
em up to the standard uv votin their tikkit; and even that time
won&rsquo;t do it if we kin git the tax taken off uv whiskey, so
that we kin afford to use it ez in the happy days uv yore.</p>
<p>Goyusly I went home to lay the foundashun uv the new temple uv
Dimocrisy. I slept that nite atween two niggers, and hev bin shakin
hands and enquirin after the health uv the families uv all I hev
met. Its rather hard for an orthodox Democrat. Sich sudden shifts
is rather wrenchin on the conshence. But what uv that? The Dimocrat
who hez follered the party closely for thirty years ought not to
balk at sich a triflin change ez this, pertiklerly when it promises
sich glorious results.</p>

February 5, 1886.</p>
<p>Last nite I retired to my virtoous couch, at precisely half past
eleven, after eatin a rather light supper for that time uv night. I
alluz make it a pint to eat light in the evenin, for I&rsquo;m
gittin old, and my digestive faculties ain&rsquo;t what they was
when I wuz young. Alas! we who hev lived out the best part uv our

<p>NASBY&rsquo;S DREAM OF THE FUTURE OF DEMOCRACY.</p>
</div>
<p>I paid my respecks to 2 mince pies, a pair uv pig&rsquo;s feet,
some cold tongue, and a plate uv tripe, <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page67" name="page67"></a>67</span>follered by a
half dozen dough nuts and a couple or more uv glasses uv hot whisky
punch; and singler ez it may seem, it didn&rsquo;t set well. I
dreamed all night, and my dreams wuznt at all pleasant. Methawt I
hed deceest, and wuz in the next world. It was a singler site that
met my vision. The dividin line atween this world and the next wuz
a swift stream uv water, and every deceest spirit hed to cross it.
The water wuz suthin like that uv the Dead Sea. A man, unencumbered
with anything, cood walk on it, but they sunk down in it if they
wuz loaded, accordin to what they hed to carry. On the tother side
uv this Jordan wuz heaven; the dominions uv his majesty Satan the
1st wuz below, and to it a strong under current flowed, which took
all them ez wuz too heavy loaded to keep their chins above
water.</p>
<p>On the bank stood more than two millions uv little devils, who
flung onto the shoulders uv them tryin to cross their failins, and
weaknesses, and iniquities.</p>
<p>General Breckinridge wuz the first that I saw enter the flood.
He hed on a life preserver, labelled &ldquo;States Rights,&rdquo;
but a peert little devil stuck a pin into it, and it collapsed, the
gas with wich it wuz filled smellin horribly. Down he went, and ez
he <span class="pagenum"><a id="page68" name=
"page68"></a>68</span>sunk, they commenced peltin him with packages
labelled &ldquo;Treason,&rdquo; &ldquo;Perjury,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Murder,&rdquo; and John C. went under.</p>
<p>Old James Buckanon went next. The old gentleman didn&rsquo;t
keep above water as long ez a able bodied man could hold a bar uv
red hot iron in his hand. He made one splash, when a weight
labelled &ldquo;Treason&rdquo; struck him, and down he went. The
gentlemanly and urbane devil who had him in charge had a big pile
more uv ammunition to discharge at him, but that one wuz
sufficient.</p>
<p>Vallandigham come next. I wuz surprised to see no one make a
motion at him, but he sunk all the same. &ldquo;We never waste
effort,&rdquo; sed Satan to me; &ldquo;he carries enough natural
cussedness about him, all the time, to sink him, without pilin any
devilment on his shoulders wich is ten days old.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Frank Peerce made his appearance, but declined to enter. He wuz
immediately seezed, and on each leg wuz tied a weight labelled
&ldquo;Kansas,&rdquo; and they flung him in. He went down like a
shot, and that&rsquo;s the last I seed uv him.</p>
<p>Garret Davis went in, and to my surprise, passed over safely.
Nothin wuz flung at him, for wich I asked the reason.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; sed Satan, &ldquo;the poor old man
isn&rsquo;t accountable. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page69" name=
"page69"></a>69</span>He commenced to talk many years ago, and
keeps on talkin because he really don&rsquo;t know when to stop. I
could hev sunk him, but the fact is, I woodent endoor what the
Senit uv the Yoonited States hez hed to, for the past few years,
for a dozen uv Tombs lawyers. Besides this, I&rsquo;m gettin more
from Kentucky now than I am really entitled to. I&rsquo;ve a
mortgage on two-thirds uv that State.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fernandy and Ben Wood come up rather bold, and entered the flood
ez though they were sure uv goin through all right. With a
inimitable chuckle, Satan motioned away the inexperienced devils,
and sed, &ldquo;Leave em to me,&rdquo; and at Ben he hurled a
package uv the New York News, wich swashed him down instanter. Jest
ez Fernandy wuz beginnin to reach the other shore, he flung onto
him an assortment uv weights, labelled &ldquo;Lotteries&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Riots,&rdquo; which took him down to the arm pits, and
finished by tumblin onto him a mass, onto wich wuz written
&ldquo;Mayoralty,&rdquo; and down he went; at wich His Majesty drew
a sigh uv relief.</p>
<p>Seein the style uv the men who sunk, I remarked unto
him,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This war hez bin a rather profitable thing for
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothin to speek uv,&rdquo; sed he. &ldquo;The leaders uv
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page70" name="page70"></a>70</span>the
Southerners were, sum uv em, honest, and got through on that
account, and the rank and file were ignorant wretches, who
ain&rsquo;t accountable, no how. The leading copperheads uv the
North were mine, anyhow, from the beginnin. Any man who cood
sympathize with the rebels in sich a struggle, must, yoo will
acknowledge, hev hed a long career uv iniquity to fit em for sich a
sin. Why,&rdquo; sed he, &ldquo;do yoo think I use all the shot I
hev? Not any. Them yoove seen piled on were used because, bein the
last, they were on the top uv the pile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any quantity uv yoor party escaped me. Them fellows who
are yet votin for Jackson I&rsquo;ll never git, and the most uv
them ez alluz votes unscratched tickets will dodge me. Their
innocence protects em. It takes a modritly smart man to be vishus
enuff to come to me; he hez to hev sense enuff to distinguish
between good and evil, cussednis enuff to deliberately choose the
latter, and brains enuff to do suthin startlin in that line. Dan
Voorhees, uv Injeany, hez all these qualities developed to a degree
wich excites my profound respect. Between him and Fernandy Wood its
nip and tuck. Fernandy did wicked things with more neatnis than
Voohees, but for a actual love uv doin em Voohees beets the world.
I sed,&rdquo; continued he, &ldquo;that the war wuzn&rsquo;t
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page71" name="page71"></a>71</span>uv
much yoose to me. I repeat it; it wuz a damage. Afore the war, I
hed my own way, pretty much, in the Southern States. For every
octoroon, I cood count on at least two planters, and under the
patriarkle system uv Afrikin slavery (wich, by the way, wuz one uv
my most brilliant consepshuns), octooroons multiplied with a
rapidity pleasin to behold. But now, alas! the octooroon bizness is
done, and my best holt is gone. I hev some little hope, however.
The Dimocrisy are displayin a vigger I didn&rsquo;t think they
possest. Ef they kin only git strength enuff to elect the next
President and re-establish slavery! The thought fills me with
unutterable joy. The redoosin of the nigger to bondage agin wood
give me a clean title to evry last one who helped to do it, and in
gittin em back into their normal condishun (by the way,
that&rsquo;s another phrase uv mine), ther&rsquo;d be enuff
slaughterin and murders to satisfy several sich Satans ez I am.
I&rsquo;d help em ef I knowd how, but I can&rsquo;t improve on
either their speekers or writers, and ez long ez men will do my
work gratis, I don&rsquo;t see the yoose uv interferin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this pint a couple uv small imps undertook to push me into
the stream, and in the struggle, I awoke. My dreem wuz o&rsquo;er,
but the impreshun remained. &ldquo;Kin it be,&rdquo; mused I,
pensively, &ldquo;that <span class="pagenum"><a id="page72" name=
"page72"></a>72</span>we are doin the devil&rsquo;s work, and are
we to be finally rewarded in the manner I saw in my vision? Ef so,
hedn&rsquo;t I better quit and repent?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But I thought agin, that however it mite be for younger men, it
wood be uv no yoose for me. I hed voted the strait ticket for
thirty years, and the ten or twelve years I hed to live wuz too
short a time in which to repent successfully uv sich iniquity. So I
sank into sleep agin, this time dreemin that I had turned
Fenian&mdash;hed elected myself Hed Center for the Stait uv
Kentucky, and wuz just investin $75,000 in a magnificent
plantashun.</p>

<p>I hev had hopes uv Androo Johnson. My waitin sole hez bin
centred onto him for a year back. He wuz the Moses wich I spected
wood lead the Democrisy out uv the desolate Egypt into which we hev
bin making bricks without straw for five long weary and dreary
years. O, how I hev yearned for Johnson! O, how I hev waited, day
after day, and week after week, and month after month, for some
manifestation uv Dimocrisy wich is satisfactory&mdash;suthin
tangible&mdash;suthin that I cood take hold on.</p>
<p>Faith is the substance uv things hoped for, and the evidence of
things not seen; wich is all right so fur <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page75" name="page75"></a>75</span>ez religion ez
concerned, but uv no account in politix. A friend uv mine, who wuz
a monomaniack on the subjick uv faith, undertook to live on it,
under the insane belief that ef a man had faith pork wuz
unnecessary. Wuz the experiment a success? Not any. When he
commenst the trial he weighed 200; in a week he wuz down to 125;
and in fourteen days he slep in the valley!</p>
<p>I hev bin livin on faith for a year or more, and I too am thin.
My bones show; light shines through me; I am faint and sick. Oh,
for suthin that I can see and feel&mdash;suthin solid!</p>
<p>Our Dimocratic noosepapers are supportin Androo Johnson. They
claim that his polisy is our polisy; that he is ourn, and we are
hizn. They are singin hosanners to him. At his every act they
exclaim Halleloogy! in chorus. What is it all about? In what
partikeler hez Androo Johnson showed hisself to be a Dimokrat? In
the name uv Dimocrisy let me ask, &ldquo;<span class="sc">Where is
the offices</span>?&rdquo; Who&rsquo;s got em? What is the
politikle convickshuns uv the wretch who is post master at the
Corners, and who only last nite refused, in the most heartless
manner, to trust me for postage stamps? Who is the Collectors, the
Assessors, et settry? Are they constitooshnel Dimokrats? Is
Stanton, and Seward, and <span class="pagenum"><a id="page76" name=
"page76"></a>76</span>Welles histed out uv the cabinet, and
Vallandigum, and Brite, and Wood apinted in their places? Not onct.
Every post master, every collector, every assessor, every officer,
is a ablishinist, dyed deeply and in fast colors.</p>
<p>Faith without works is a weak institution; its like a whisky
punch with the whisky omitted, wich is a disgustin mixter uv warm
water and sugar. What is it to me (who hev bin ready to accept any
position uv wich the salary wuz sufficient to maintain a
individooal uv simple habits) who is beheaded, so ez I don&rsquo;t
get a place? Androo Johnson may cut off offishl heads ez
dexterously and proofoosely ez he chooses; but my sole refuses to
thrill when I know that Ablishnists, though uv a different stripe,
will be apinted. So long ez Dimocrats are kept out, what care I who
hez the places? Paul may plant and Apollus water; but uv what
account is the plantin and waterin to me ef I don&rsquo;t get the
increase? I take no delight in sich spectacles. Ef Androo Johnson
proposes to be a Dimockrat,&mdash;ef he desires the honest, hearty
support of the party,&mdash;let him seel his faith with works.</p>
<p>I visited Washington with the express purpose uv seein the
second Jackson. I am a frank man, and I laid the matter afore him
without hesitation. I told <span class="pagenum"><a id="page77"
name="page77"></a>77</span>him that the Postmaster at the Corners
wuz opposin his policy and aboosin him continually; that it wuz a
outrage that men holdin place under the Administration should not
sustain the Administration. In the name uv Right, I demanded a
change.</p>
<p>I sposed that to wunst the position would be offered to me; and
after protestin a sufficient time that I did not wish it, and would
prefer the apintment of some more worthy man, I should accept it,
and go home provided for three years. Imagine my deep, my
unutterable disgust, when he told me that he wood investigate the
matter, and probably wood make a change, <span class="sc">provided
he could find, in the vicinity, some original Union man who would
accept the place</span>!</p>
<p>Then the iron entered my soul. Then I felt that in him we had no
lot nor part.</p>
<p>Our principles are uv a very comprehensive nature. We are willin
to endorse Andro Johnson, or any other man. We will endorse his
theories uv Reconstruction, or any man&rsquo;s theories. We are
elastic, like Injy rubber. The boy who set a hen on a hundred eggs
acknowledged to his maternal parent that she could not kiver em;
but he remarked he wanted to see the old thing spred herself. We
have that spreadin capacity. We kin accommodate <span class=

away with slavery in the District of Columby and for the
Constooshnel Amendment. In Kentucky we are hangin men uv the John
Brown style, and mobbin all uv the persuasion uv the Connecticut
nominee. Sich a variety uv principle,&mdash;a party uv sich

there is no diversity uv opinion, and to which all other ideas is
subordinate. That idea is <span class="sc">Post Office</span>! and
ef Androo Johnson could be got rite on that question, we&rsquo;d
care not wat else he required uv us.</p>
<p>We hev our arms around Androo. We are huggin him to our buzzums;
but he hez left his baggage to hum. That baggage is wat we want;
and we shel fling him off shortly, onless he changes his policy in
this respeck. He kin hev us on easy terms; but he must furnish the
ammunishun with which to fight his battles. Will he do it?
That&rsquo;s the question a hundred thousand hungry soles, who
hanker even ez I do, are daily askin.</p>

<p class="ch_desc">The President&rsquo;s 22d of February
Speech.&mdash;The Account thereof of One behind the
Scenes.&mdash;Hopes and Fears of the Democracy.</p>
<p class="address"><span class="sc">Washington</span>, February 23,
1866.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know; but there is a still small voice within me
wich whispers, &ldquo;All is well!&rdquo; The delusive phantom,
Hope, may be playin false with me. The wish may be paternal parient
to the thought, and I may be indulgin in a dream from wich I shel
be, to-morrer, roodly awakened; but it&rsquo;s my opinion that the
day-star uv glory hez arozen onto the Dimocracy; that our night uv
gloom is over; and that, at larst, the Government, or at least the
only part we care about,&mdash;the offisis,&mdash;is ourn. I heerd
Androo Johnson speak last nite! I stood beside him! I helpt hold
him up! I <span class="sc">smelt his breath</span>. It&rsquo;s all
rite!</p>
<p>I hed hopes when he vetoed that large and varied assortment uv
Ablishn abominashens,&mdash;the Freedmen&rsquo;s <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page80" name="page80"></a>80</span>Burow
bill,&mdash;notwithstandin there were pints in his message I
coodent sanction. The veto wuz heavenly, but his reasons were
unsound. When he expressed hisself ez bein determined upon sekoorin
the niggers in their rites, I felt fearful that there wuz a honist
diffrence uv opinion atween him and Congress wich mite be settled,
and then what wood become uv us? Ef the niggers is to hev rites, in
the name uv Heaven, I asked myself, what difference does it make to
us whether they hev em by Charles Sumner&rsquo;s system (on whose
head rest cusses!), or A. Johnson&rsquo;s? And ez is customary when
men ask theirselves questions, I got no answer. Men never ask
theirselves questions wich kin be answered.</p>
<p>But last nite my doubts wuz removed. Little Sam Cox, and Dan
Voorhees, and the Woods, and Tom Florence, and Coyle, and me, hed
bin with Androo all day. The Ablishnists avoided him after the
veto; and knowin he&rsquo;d done suthin he wuzn&rsquo;t quite shoor
wuz wise, he needed bracin up, and we wuz ready to brace him.
Isn&rsquo;t it singler that men, when they go to the devil, alluz
go in squads? Cox hed him cornered all day, a readin to him extrax
from Forney&rsquo;s Press, and choice selections from
Sumner&rsquo;s speeches; and Voorhees and the others <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page81" name="page81"></a>81</span>wuz a intimatin
to him that only in the buzzum uv the Dimocrisy cood he find that
conjeniality uv sperit so nessary to him; and by the time the
serenade wuz ready, he wuz ez full uv venom ez wuz possible, and
his capassity in that line is immense.</p>
<p>The company all went with him onto the stand, and my eyes saw
the first cheerin vision wich they hev beheld for years. Before us
stood ten thousand or more Dimocrats. There wuz the veteran from
Lee&rsquo;s army in his soot uv gray, which hed, by continyood
contact with the pavements uv Washington&mdash;wich, not hevin bin
slept on much, sense Bookannon&rsquo;s time, they don&rsquo;t
sweep&mdash;hed become somewhat uv the color uv the clay. There wuz
the offiser who surrendered with Johnston, and them noble sons uv
Baltimore, and Rawly, and Charleston, who, though they didn&rsquo;t
serve their section in the field, were ardent in their support uv
the cause. There were the old-style Dimocrats uv the North, whose
faith in Johnson&rsquo;s Dimocrisy, based upon the scene wich took
place at the inauguration, wuz greater than mine, hed come on with
their applications for Post Offises, and who jined so heartily in
the cheers wich went up for J. Davis: and there, addressin this
crowd, wuz a President&mdash;the man <span class="pagenum"><a id=
"page82" name="page82"></a>82</span>who had the appintin power in
his hands&mdash;who cood make and unmake Post Offisis.</p>
<p>It did me good, and yet I doubtid. Wood he go through with it?
Wood he lock horns with Wade and Sumner, and dare the wrath uv Thad
Stevens? Wood he? He wavered and shrunk back ez he saw the style uv
the awdience before him; for he hed bin, for four years, accustomed
to better dressed people. But Cox and Florence wuz ekal to the
emergency. Samyooel whispered into his one ear,
&ldquo;Whitewash!&rdquo; and Florence into tother, &ldquo;Charles
the I.!&rdquo; and flamin up like a conflagratid oil well, he waded
it. Then I felt that it wuz all right. Then my soul expanded; and
ez he went on, pilin Billinsgate upon Billinsgate, usin Tennessee
stump slang, improved by a liberal mixter uv the more desprit
variety he hed picked up in Washinton and Baltimore, I felt that it
wuz indeed well with us. He wuz talkin ez a Dimokrat to Dimokrats;
and it wuz appreciated. Strippin off all uv the disguise he hed bin
a wearin for four years,&mdash;washin off, in rage and whisky, the
varnish and putty with wich he hed shined up his dullness, and
filled up the cracks and cavities wich hed alluz troubled
him,&mdash;he stood forth ez we knowd him&mdash;Androo Johnson! How
he did froth and foam! How he did lash his <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page83" name="page83"></a>83</span>late
associates! and how those Dimokrats who kum to Washinton with
petitions for places in their pockets did wink at each other, and
poke each other in the ribs, with exultation and jockelarity wich
they cood not conceal! And how the Ablishnists, wich hung onto the
outskirts uv the crowd, in the hope that he wood declare himself in
sich a way ez to give em some hope, did walk away sorrowfully and
sore, ez tho they felt that they hed a new trouble afore em! And
how the soljers uv Lee, and the quartermasters wich hed made
Richmond their headquarters doorin the war, did cheer and sling
their hats into the air, and in the uncontrollable enthoosiasm uv
the moment invariably snatch better ones from the heads uv the
Northern men in the crowd! It wuz gorgus.</p>
<p>While His Eggslency&rsquo;s course gives me hope, I don&rsquo;t
want it to be understood that I am prepared to fully and entirely
indorse him. I don&rsquo;t go much on men who do things in a state
uv madnis; neither do I invest heavy in that Dimokrat wich requires
an extra load uv likker to make him act and talk like a Dimokrat.
Androo Johnson was and is a Dimokrat&mdash;a ginooine Dimokrat. The
accident uv his learnin to read, in his yooth, gave him a
pre&euml;minence over us in Tennessee, and put him through
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page84" name="page84"></a>84</span>the
various places he hez filled. His affinities wuz with us; his style
wuz our style, and his habits our habits; and he hed no biznis to
ever git out uv the fold. I cannot forgit that he went back on us
at a critikle time in the histry uv the party. He saw that the
effort the Dimocrisy uv the South wuz makin to regain their rites
wood be a failyoor; the aristocracy uv the South hed snubbed him,
and refoozed to recognize him; but all this shood not hev affected
him. It&rsquo;s the normal condishn uv the lower grade uv Dimokrats
to be snubbed; and they hev no rite to inquire whether anything the
aristocracy uv the party propose is goin to be a failyoor or not.
It&rsquo;s their dooty to obey orders without questionin.</p>
<p>Wat spiled Johnson wuz Massachoosits. He pretended to be loyal,
and Massachoosits patted him on the back. They took him into good
society. They let him associate with Sumner and sich, and the man
became infatooated. He got to drinkin high priced drinks, and
wearin clean shirts, and begun to ape the manners uv those into
whose sphere he hed bin thrown, There wuz these two opposin forces
contendin within him&mdash;nateral proclivities and acquired
tastes&mdash;wich may be represented by whiskey out uv a jug, and
mint jooleps at Willard&rsquo;s. Massychoosits <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page85" name="page85"></a>85</span>wuz a pullin
him up, and North Carolina wuz equally vigorously pullin him down.
He wantid to stay with Massychoosits, but he wuz uncomfortable all
the time; and finally nacher asserted her supremacy, and he broke
over, and like the water long confined in a dam, when its bustid
its obstructions, and goes, it goes with a loosenis, and tears up,
and takes a very large quantity uv dirt and drift wood with it.</p>
<p>Before I tie myself to A.J., I want to know fer certin what he
proposes to do. <span class="sc">Who is to hev the Post
Offisis</span>? Is Ablishnists to still retain the places uv trust
and profit? Does he propose to organize a new party, made up uv
sich Republikins ez he can indoose to foller him and the Dimocrisy?
Ef so, I ain&rsquo;t in. Decidedly, I ain&rsquo;t in. Emphatically,
count me out. For the reason, that he kin git jist enuff
Republikins, percisely, and no more, to fill the offisis, and they
will be uv sich a character ez will do the Dimokrisy no credit. I
won&rsquo;t be tail to no kite. We are willin to play kite; but
tail, never! Ef we boost Androo Johnson, Androo Johnson must boost
us. Does he think we kin carry sich a load ez he is for nothin?
Nary. Ef we hev a consoomin desire to git along without offisis, we
are doin very well at that now, we <span class="pagenum"><a id=
"page86" name="page86"></a>86</span>thank you; and we haven&rsquo;t
the responsibility uv the Administration uv a eggstremely shaky man
to carry. Sich loads must be paid for.</p>
<p>But, after all, I hev hopes. He hez cut hisself loose from
Sumner and Stevens; and in less than a week every Republikin uv
modrit sensibilities will be aboozin uv him to that extent that he
won&rsquo;t be able to git back agin. He&rsquo;s an animal uv the
bull kind; and criticism and opposition is to him the red flag wich
the Spanish matadors, I bleeve they call em, waves afore the
animals they wish to infooriate, and they may drive him into our
ranks.</p>
<p>I wait, and watch, and hope. Ef I kin wunst git a commission,
with the broad seel uv the Postmaster General onto it, confirmin me
in the possession uv the Post orifis at the Corners, I shel bless
the day that Androo Johnson left us, and prokoored his elevation to
the Presidency. May the day be hastened!</p>

<p>In the name uv suffrin Kentucky, uv wich State I am a adopted

<p>In the name uv common sense and ordnary politikle sagassity, I
protest!</p>
<p>Androo Johnson may possibly be on the high road to Dimocrisy;
but, ez yet, what ashoorence hev we? Am I datin my letters from
&ldquo;Post Orifis, Confedrit &times; Roads?&rdquo; Hez there bin,
as yit, any well authenticated case uv the removal uv a Ablishnist,
and the apintment uv a constooshnel Democrat in his stead?
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page88" name="page88"></a>88</span>Not
that I hev heard of. Per contrary, the Ablishnists&mdash;them ez
wuz apinted by Linkin&mdash;are still holdin on, ez calm ez a
summer mornin, without any apparent fear uv any change affectin
them.</p>
<p>Who pays for the Halls? Who pays the music? Who pays the Powder?
Dimocrats who do these scent Post Offises in the distanse. Are they
like the the war hoss in Job&rsquo;s writins, who smelled the
battle afar off, and remarked Ha, Ha! to the trumpets? Let me
enticet sich that they kin make a better investment uv their
means.</p>
<p>The cost uv one meetin, put in korn whisky, wood not only solace
theirselves, but start half a dozen Ablishnists on the road to
Dimocrisy.</p>
<p>Men is deceptive. I hev hopes uv Androo Johnson myself, and
principally becoz Vallandigum and Fernandy Wood hev hopes. Them
buzzards kin smell carrion a long distance, and they are seldom at
fault. In this case, they may be. They base their hopes on
Johnson&rsquo;s speech, at Washington, on the 22d. There may be
suthin in it; but ain&rsquo;t it possible that the stench wich they
took for Dimocrisy, and wich they sposed cum from Johnson, ariz
from them ez surrounded him?</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; sez a Dimocrat, whose nose, from long
continued lack of supplies, hez softened down from <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page89" name="page89"></a>89</span>a generous
crimson to a ghastly bloo, and who woodent hev a small Post orifis
at no price, ef it wuznt offered him, &ldquo;look at the class he
spoke to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wat noncents! Androo wuz mad. There wuz a mass uv bile on hiz
politikle stumick wich must be got rid uv. He had sum nasty things
to say, and it wuz a part uv the eternal fitness uv things that he
shood hev a nasty audience to say em to.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t propose to go orf into spasms over the present
sitooashun. Johnson proposes to continoo the Freedmens&rsquo; Buro,
and hezn&rsquo;t no noshun of repeelin the test oath, or uv drawin
the military out uv the Dimocratik States. So far as heard from, we
uv the South is still in a stait of abject custitood. Our habis
corpuses wich Linkin took away from us hevn&rsquo;t bin returned,
and we are obleeged to git along ez best we kin without em. I
knocked down a small nigger yisterday, for the purpus uv assertin
the sooperiority uv the Cauchashun race over the Afrikin, and wuz
to wunst hauled up afore a Freedmen&rsquo;s Buro, and fined. Our
high-toned and chivalrous members are exclooded from Congris on the
frivolus plea that they wuz kernels and briggydeer Ginerals in the
Confederit servis; and all these outragis <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page90" name="page90"></a>90</span>agin Dimocrisy
Androo Johnson, by permittin, absolootly approves.</p>
<p>I could probably swaller all these things. I am a Dimokrat uv
thirty years standin, and, uv course, hev bin on both sides uv
every politikle fence. The seats of my politikle pants is full of
slivers. But, before I take down these things, I WANT TO KNOW WHAT
I AM GOIN TO GIT FOR IT. Ef Androo Johnson goes back on his party
and his pledges, he, uv course, asks us to go back on ourn. In sich
transactions, where both parties, by bein engaged in it at all,
confess themselves ruther a low grade of skoundrels, I think it
well enuff to hev the consideration paid down.</p>
<p>Ef Androo Johnson wants me, he knows the terms. I am his to
command, for a consideration; ez much so ez is the thousands uv
Demokrats who hev bin, for the past week, gittin up Demonstrations.
But I want suthin to go on. When I hev his permisson, under the
broad seel uv the Post Orfis Department, to write
&ldquo;P.M.&rdquo; after my illustrious name, I shell be prepared
to wade in. I hev bin huntin up several reasons for supportin him.
I hev em all ready. I only want this additional one, and then I
fling my banner to the breeze. Faith is sed to be the sun of all
religious systems. <span class="sc">Post Offis</span> <span class=

March 12, 1866.</p>
<p>The politikle sky is orecast with friteful clouds. Darkness is
on the face uv the waters. The waves is a rollin mountin high, the
litenin flashes ominous thro the gloom, and the deep-mouthed
thunder mutters angrily in the distants. Ez a sentinel on the
watch-tower, I look out, and what do I see? I see the old ship uv
State loaded down with a valuable cargo uv Post-offices,
Collectorships, and sich, a laborin in the trough uv the sea, her
bowsprit cove in, her top-gallant lanyards bustid, her jib-boom a
flutterin in the gale, her capstan spliced, and her sheet anker
torn to ribbons. (Not hevin bin a sailor, only ez a driver on the
Wabash Kanal, it is possible my nautikle terms may not be
altogether correct. But it makes no difference in the <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page93" name="page93"></a>93</span>interior uv
Kentucky.) She is strivin to make her harbor, and is workin
manfully. Close behind her is the long, low, rakish skooner
Dimocrisy, with all sale set, a tryin her best to overtake her and
board her. For a time it seemed ez tho she wood be successful, but
alas! she is fallin astern, and every minnit the distance between
em is a widenin, widenin, widenin, and at present writin there
ain&rsquo;t the remotest prospect uv their gettin within hailin
distance uv each other.</p>
<p>To drop mettafor (wich, by the way, I kin jerk when I feel so
disposed), the prospect isn&rsquo;t ez encouragin ez it wuz, and I
fear, in fact I feel certain, that the short cut to offis wich the
Democrisy thought it had found through Androo Johnson&rsquo;s veto,
is reely the longest way round. I cannot understand what indoost
the Dimocratic leaders, our chosin standard-bearers, to make sich
egrejus asses uv theirselves ez to place enny dependence on Johnson
at all. What cood they hev bin thinkin uv? Wuz not our experience
in 1864 sufficient to deter em from makin any experiment wich
involved abandonment uv any uv our principles? Didn&rsquo;t we, in
the hope uv ketchin Abolition war votes, nominate MickLellan, and
didn&rsquo;t the war men jeer us, and flout us, and say,
&ldquo;Behold, we hev better war men uv our own; why <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page94" name="page94"></a>94</span>shood we leave
home to find that uv wich we hev a plenty?&rdquo; When Androo
Johnson, in a fit uv temporary indignashun, split on Sumner, why
did our people, like idiots, pick him up, and endorse him without
givin the matter matoor considerashun&mdash;without waitin for the
fax? Didn&rsquo;t they know that Sumner wuz a sort uv a dose uv
calomel, wich worked on the President&rsquo;s liver, and
necessitated the discharge uv all the offensive matter wich hed
accumulated doorin his long term uv Dimocrisy? Uv course it wuz,
and to-day Androo Johnson, hevin in that speech got rid uv the last
vestidge uv Dimocrisy wich infected him, comes up a stronger man
agin us than ever. We made two errors: On the 4th uv March, 1865,
at his inoggerashun, when he made a spectacle uv hisself, we
murmured gently to ourselves, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right!
he&rsquo;s yet wun uv us.&rdquo; And we sed the same after the
splurge uv the 22d uv February last. Oh, my friends, they wuz both
fatal errors. Them spasms wuz the efforts uv a noble nacher a tryin
to git rid uv Locofocoism, and from the fact that he immejitely
after commenst a missellaneously apintin Abilishnists and
Republicans to offises, and hezn&rsquo;t showed a sine uv a
disposition to extend his hand to a single confidin Democrat,
it&rsquo;s my opinion he&rsquo;s succeeded.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page95" name=
"page95"></a>95</span>We bet too heavy on the fight atween the
President and Sumner. Sumner is ordained to alluz hev a gong uv sum
kind, which he is also ordained to keep perpetually a poundin.
He&rsquo;s bin for several years amusin hisself a poundin the
Dimocrisy, and when there wuzn&rsquo;t enuff uv that to make it
interestin, he turned on Johnson, and he&rsquo;ll pound at him till
suthin else excites his wrath. He&rsquo;s a Spanish bull, possessin
sharp horns, and a immense amount uv strength and agility, which he
is continooally a wastin by jumpin at sich red flags ez are
mischeevusly waved afore him. He&rsquo;s jest ez apt to gore his
frends ez his enemies, and his lungin at Johnson wuz no sign that
Johnson had gone back on Ablishnism.</p>
<p>But enuff uv this. Sence it hez become a fixed fact that the
boorish tailor, who now by accident okkepies the place uv the
marter Linkin, made vacant by his untimely death by the hand uv a
vile assassin (whose only redeemin trait wuz that he wuz a stanch,
uncompromisin Dimocrat),&mdash;now, I say, that it&rsquo;s plain
that this drunken sot ain&rsquo;t agoin to distribute the patronage
amongst us who need it so much, I ask, in indignashun, wat is it
that we are asked to endorse?</p>
<p>He proposes to continue the Freedmen&rsquo;s Buro bizness.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page96" name=
"page96"></a>96</span>He refooses to withdraw the military from the
Dimokratic States.</p>
<p>He refooses to restore to our sufferin brethren uv the
Dimocratic States the habis corpusses wich the tyrant Linkin
wrested from them.</p>
<p>He keeps Jefferson Davis a pinin in a loathsome dungeon, and
only refooses to bring him to trial becoz, 4sooth, he haint yet got
things in the right shape to hang him.</p>
<p>I cood enumerate other insults and opressions he hez piled upon
Dimocrats, but I forbear. I might, if I wuz disposed to harrow up
the Dimocratic sole and lasserate the Dimocratic bosom, state how I
wuz treated, when, on the 24th uv Febrooary last I made a
delegashun uv myself, and went to Washington for the purpose uv
layin before him the necessity uv the removal uv the postmaster at
the Corners, and the apintment uv myself in his stead. I found that
his speech had reached all other parts uv the Yoonited States ez
soon ez it hed Kentucky, for there wuz suthin over a hundred
thousand stanch Dimocrats there, all with petitions noomerously
signed, wich they hed held over from Bookannon&rsquo;s
administration, recommendin uv em to places. How wuz we reseeved?
How did Androo Johnson treet us? I mite say how emphatically I wuz
shoved out uv <span class="pagenum"><a id="page97" name=
"page97"></a>97</span>his room, and with what reckless profanity I
heerd him remark that Washington had stunk with secesh ever since
he vetoed the bill; that that foolish speech had acted on the whole
country like a puke, and that each State had spewed its foulest
material onto Washington, and that the atmosphere wuz heavy with
their breath, et settry, et settry, but I forbear.</p>
<p>Suffice it to say that the few Democratic members uv Congress
had hard work borrowin money enuff to git the most spectable uv the
crowd home agin, and even then thousands uv em who wuz drawed there
by that speech, shoor uv apintments, wuz obliged to <em>walk</em>
home ignominiously, uv whom I wuz which.</p>
<p>Androo Johnson may be worthy uv Dimocratic support, but he hez a
queer way uv showin it. I know not wat others may do, but ez for me
and my household I&rsquo;ll run after no strange gods. Ef he wants
us, let him call on us in language wich we kin understand.</p>

"page99"></a>99</span>well, I may say intimately. He wuz a dear
friend,&mdash;one uv the few wich I kall friend in the most
catholic and comprehensive sense uv the word. He holds my note fur
eighteen dollars and 63 cents; and I hev sumwhere among my papers,
wich I have alluz carefully preserved for reference, a memorandum
uv his address, that I might be shoor not to forget to send it to
him. I give him the note becoz he furnished the paper, and it made
him easy in his mind&mdash;I put down the memorandum bekoz it
looked business-like. Benevolence is a prominent trait in my
karacter. When givin my note for borrered money will do a man good,
I never begrudge the trouble uv writin it.</p>
<p>But wat I wuz a goin to say wuz, that the feendishnis uv that
item passes belief. The writer puts it in print to show that the
Ablishn uv slavry benefitted sumbody. I grant him that the
merchant, who undoubtedly wuz born in Massachusetts, wuz benefitted
by the change; so are the greesy mechanics who are now pollutin the
soil uv Alabama; and so, probably, are the 250 niggers; but, in the
name uv Liberty, in the name uv Justice, in the name uv the
Constertooshun uv the Yoonited States, and the flag uv our Common
Country, I ask, <span class="sc">How about John Guttle</span>?</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page100" name=
"page100"></a>100</span>John Guttle is robbed. John Guttle is
deprived uv his property. The bred is taken from John
Guttle&rsquo;s mouth; his staff is broken; his dependence is gone;
he is bereft.</p>
<p>Never shall I forget John Guttle or his hospitable mansion, ez I
knowed it in the happy year afore the crooel war. He wuz a
gentleman uv the old skool&mdash;one uv the few left us in these
degenerate days. His home wuz wun uv unalloyed happiness. Situated
just back uv Mobeel, he had the finest plantashun in that section,
and hed on it 250 niggers. All shades wuz represented. There wuz
the coal-black Cuffee, whose feechers denoted the pure Afrikin, and
whose awkward manners showed that he wuz not long from Afrika.
There wuz the civilized mulatto, in whose veins the Guttle blood
showed; the quadroon, in whom the good old Guttle blood
predominated; and the octoroon, which wuz mostly Guttle. The
Guttleses wuz eminently a Christian generation. They wuz devoutly
pious; and there never wuz one uv the name who cood not repeat,
without the book, all uv the texts bearin on slavery. The passages
in which Onesimus and Hager figger wuz favorites with em; but on
&ldquo;cussid be Canaan&rdquo; they wuz strong. For generations
they had mourned over the hard fate uv the sons uv Ham, doomed to
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page101" name=
"page101"></a>101</span>perpetooal bondage becoz uv the sin uv
their father; and with a missionary spirit ekaled by few and
excelled by none, they did their part towards redoosin that cuss,
by makin ez many of em ez possible half-brothers to the more
favored race uv Japhet, and thus bringing uv em out uv the cuss;
and they had mellered the color uv their charges down from the
hideous black to a bright yeller. Under the old patriarkle system,
time passed orf smoothly and pleasantly with the Guttle family.
Them 250 niggers wuz obliged, uv course, to work, and their labor
wuz money. John bought each uv the male sons uv Ham too soots uv
close per annum, and each uv the female sons uv Ham one soot. It
wuz considered healthy for the young ones to go naked, which they
wuz religiously allowed to do, ez none uv the Guttles uv that
family wood do any thing agin nater or her laws. The girls hed
pianos, and wuz educated at the North; the boys wuz celebrated for
horse racing and their skill at losin money at faro. They wuz
hospitable and generous to a fault. Their house wuz open house, and
their beverages wuz alluz the best. Money wuz no objick to them;
for when they had a severe attack of poker, or faro, or hoss racin,
they hed plenty uv octoroons and quadroons, with the real Guttle
nose, wich brand <span class="pagenum"><a id="page102" name=
"page102"></a>102</span>wuz well known in Noo Orleans, and wood
alluz command the highest possible figger that wuz paid in that
market; or, ef they had no more than they wanted at home uv that
style, why, a few field hands wood be sold, and the remainin ones
wood be persuaded by the overseer to do the work uv the whole. John
Guttle&rsquo;s sons wuz all in the Confederit army. His daughters,
willin to sacrifice every thing fur the cause, heroically pledged
theirselves to whip the niggers theirselves doorin their
absence.</p>
<p>Now all is changed! A shadder hez fallen across that peaceful
home. The nigger quarters is there, but the niggers is not. The
broad plantashun is divided up into small farms, and half uv it is
owned by Ablishnists from the North, who work theirselves, and who
hev a meetin house on one corner uv it, and the niggers a skool
house on the tother. The race track is plowed up and in cotton; the
whippin-post and the stocks is taken down and burned; all, all the
evidences uv civilizashun hez faded afore the ruthless hand of the
invader. John Guttle&mdash;that generous old man&mdash;subsists by
the labor uv his own hands. One uv his sons ekes out a miserable
existence running a dray in Mobeel; another, who is gifted with no
ordinary intelleck, earns a respectable livin playin seven-up; in a
small way, with his former <span class="pagenum"><a id="page103"
name="page103"></a>103</span>niggers; and the two girls is runnin a
sewing masheen.</p>
<p>Talk not to me uv benefits. What is a dozen tradesmen and two
hundred and fifty niggers to the gellorious old Dimocratic John
Guttle? What is the interest uv a dozen or so uv Noo England
mechanics, and the niggers aforesaid, when compared to that
glorious aristocracy which can never exist beside em? Kin I go and
borrer eighteen dollars and sixty-three cents uv one uv them? No.
Becoz, working for their paltry livins, they place a higher valyoo
on money, and will not spread it around ez profoosely ez the nobble
race which preceded em.</p>
<p>Another great wrong is done in this settin free uv John
Guttle&rsquo;s niggers. John Guttle hez, uv course, no further
interest in the Dimocratic party. Slavery wuz the umbillikle cord
which united the Southern slaveholder and the Northern Dimocrat;
and, that cord cut, why hez John Guttle any more interest in
Dimocracy? We stood ez a Chinese wall between them and the rushin
flood uv Ablishn fanaticism; and we made the wall biznis pay. They
furnished money, and we did the work; and, there bein but few uv
us, the orfisis wuz easily divided. Alas! our okepashin&rsquo;s
gone. The South is forever lost to us; for she has no dirty work
for us to do.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page104" name=
"page104"></a>104</span>I appeal to the Yoonited States uv America.
In behalf uv John Guttle, I say, give him back his niggers. In
behalf uv the Dimocrisy North who are out uv employment, give him
back his niggers. In behalf uv his son who is runnin a dray, give
him back his niggers. In behalf uv his daughters runnin a sewin
machine, give him back his niggers. Make things Normal agin. Like
John the Baptist, the Government shall hear the voice uv one howlin
in the wilderness until all these is done.</p>

(wich is in the Stait uv Kentucky),<br />
March 30, 1866.</p>
<p>I hev bin to Washinton. That Ablishn Postmaster at the Corners
hed become to me a nitemare. Day after day I seed him a handlin
guvment money, drawin his salery promptly, and takin his drinks
reglerly, while I, a Constooshnel Dimekrat, a supporter uv our
great and good President, wuz forced to the humiliashun uv waitin
till I wuz treated, ceptin when a new grocery keeper cum in, which
gave me a chance to establish a credit for a short time. I felt
that sumthin must be done, and therefore I went to Washinton.</p>
<p>Knowin that for men uv my profound convickshins, holdin my views
ez to consiliashen and sich, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page106"
name="page106"></a>106</span>I hed no call to go to the
Postmaster-General, who is a Ablishnist, I went dreckly to the
Second Jaxon hisself. I succeeded in gettin a audience late in the
afternoon. Our patron saint wuz a sittin at a table, eggsausted
with receevin delegashens and sich.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; sed he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Honerd and spected sir,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I am a
applicant for the post orfis at Confedrit &times; Roads, wich is at
present held by a Ablishnist who does not beleeve in yoor policy,
wich I do beleeve in solemnly. Spected and honered sir,&rdquo; sed
I, &ldquo;ef I shood have twins born to me this nite, I shood name
em both Policy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wich State are yoo from?&rdquo; sed he, half asleep.</p>
<p>&ldquo;From Kentucky, honered and spected sir,&rdquo; sed I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; sed he, yawnin feerfully, and turnin to a
clerk, &ldquo;<span class="sc">Fill out a pardon, and give him a
commission</span>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Honered and spected sir,&rdquo; sed I, in a fit of
loonacy for wich I can&rsquo;t account, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t need a
pardon. I wuz never in the late lamented Confedrit
servis.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;n thunder, then, are yoo here for, beggin a
post offis? Git out, yoo imposter!&rdquo; and I wuz too wunst
ignominiously showed to the door. I <span class="pagenum"><a id=
"page107" name="page107"></a>107</span>didn&rsquo;t quite
understand the lay uv the land around the White House.</p>
<p>In vane I tried to git back, that I might convince him I did ez
much for the Confederasy ez my humble abilities permitted, and that
I needed consiliatin ez badly ez anybody. Then, hart broke and dead
broke, not heving the wherewith to prokoor more sootable lodgin, I
lay me down on the cold stun steps, and sought refuge from my
troubles in sleep.</p>
<p>I dreemed a dream. Methawt I wuz in a room in the White House.
Stretched out on one side uv the room wuz the corpse uv a giant, a
monster in size and strength, but withal uv a pleasin presence, and
fair to look upon. Onto its head was a liberty cap, and by its side
wuz a sword, considerably dinted, and with all the gildin knocked
off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wat is these?&rdquo; sed I, pointin to the corpse, askin
a sort uv a attendant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Them,&rdquo; replied he, &ldquo;is the defunct carcass uv
Republikinism. He was a hefty yooth in his day, but he died this
mornin. Look! the mourners are a comin to divide his
clothes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And shoor enuff, they came in. At the head wuz the second Jaxon,
which the Ablishnists derisively call Moses, who appeared to be
angry, and clost behind him wuz Seward, a weepin out uv one eye,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page108" name=
"page108"></a>108</span>and a smilin out uv tother, and Jim Lane,
who hed a handkercher wich he occasionally put to his eyes, but
wich I notist wuz ez dry ez a lime kiln, and Doolittle, and Lee,
and Raymond, and Beauregard, and Cowan, and Stephens, and Thurlow
Weed, and Vallandigham, and Governor Sharkey, and a host uv others,
all uv wich ranged theirselves around the bier.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He wuz a promisin yooth,&rdquo; sed Seward, a puttin his
handkercher to his eyes, &ldquo;but the atmosphere uv the White
House wuz too much for him. I insist, however,&rdquo; sed he, a
pocketin the handkercher, and takin hold uv a trinket the corpse
held in his hand, labelled &ldquo;Presidency, 1868,&rdquo; from
which hung mor&rsquo;n a million uv smaller trinkets, &ldquo;that
ez &rsquo;twas me that pizened him, this is mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nary,&rdquo; sed Johnson; &ldquo;I did the biziness for
him, and it&rsquo;s mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Settle it ez yoo please,&rdquo; sed Raymond, gently,
&ldquo;but whoever gits it must remember that this Secretaryship is
mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I,&rdquo; sed Doolittle, &ldquo;must hev, for my
assistance, this little affair marked &lsquo;St. James,&rsquo; for
my seat in the Senit is a goner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For my part,&rdquo; sed Jim Lane, &ldquo;the western
appointments is mine. Its worth em all to wear this
collar.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page109" name=
"page109"></a>109</span>&ldquo;My friends,&rdquo; sed Stephens,
&ldquo;I find no amnesty about the corpse. There must be one
manufactured and stuck in his pocket, to be prodoost at the
funeral.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thurlow Weed sed nothin, but looked on with a sardonic smile,
knowin perfeckly well that whoever took the biggest part uv the
plunder, he&rsquo;d control it, any way.</p>
<p>Governor Sharkey laid claim to a secretaryship, and Boregard to
the place uv Sherman, and Lee to Grant&rsquo;s position, and
Vallandigham wanted this, and tother feller that, and there wuz a
terrible hubbub over the corpse. Wilkes Booth&rsquo;s gost came in,
and wanted to know what he wuz to hev in the new deal,
&ldquo;for,&rdquo; sed he, &ldquo;ef&rsquo;t hadn&rsquo;t bin for
me, where&rsquo;d yoo all hev bin? Talk uv the White House
atmosphere killin him! I&rsquo;m sure the shadder uv the buildin
blasted what little uv his spirit yoo hed,&rdquo; sed he, a turnin
to Seward, &ldquo;but ef Linkin hed lived, ha, ha!&rdquo; sed he,
in a tragedy voise. Then in trooped a lot uv other gosts. There wuz
Bill Allen, uv Ohio, and Washington Hunt, uv Noo York, and Jeems
Bookannon, uv Pennsylvania, and Eli Thayer, and Lew. Campbell, and
Garret Davis, who started to make a speech, but the entire
assemblage stuck their fingers in their ears, wich hint he took for
the first time in his life, and desisted.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page110" name=
"page110"></a>110</span>Finally Johnson swore &ldquo;by the
eternal&rdquo; (he got that noshun from the first A.J., wich he
thinks he resembles, coz his innitials is the same, and coz the
original vetoed a bill wunst) that he wood hev the Presidency, and
gobbled it. Seward, he snatched at it, and they tussled. The
company stood by to see it out, for it made but little difference
to them wich got it. In the skrimage Johnson happened to ram Seward
up agin a window on the north side uv the room, and smashed it out.
Jest then a blast uv north wind poured into the room through the
aperture, and blowed onto the face uv the corpse. The effect was
electrikle. Life ran through his veins, his face flushed, and the
livid hue was changed to the ruddy glow uv health. The dead wuz
alive; the giant raised to his feet, and looked around him, shakin
off them ez wuz a hangin to him like insex. Noticin the trinket
wich hed caused the skrimage in Johnson&rsquo;s hand, he took him
by the neck, and twistin it out uv his hand, flung him gently
through the winder. &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t made up my mind who to
give this to, but yoo bet it ain&rsquo;t yoo,&rdquo; sed he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Willyum,&rdquo; sed he, turnin to Seward,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m surprised at yoo. Wuz this bauble the price uv
yoor honesty and yoor principle? Go, Willyum! Ez for yoo,
Doolittle, yoo never wuz half baked; yoo, <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page111" name="page111"></a>111</span>Thurlow, put
Raymond in your vest pocket, and quit the presence. Yoo, Jim Lane,
I leave to the tender mercies uv my friends in Kansas. Clear out
the balance uv this rabble, and send for my friends. I&rsquo;ve bin
pizened, and smothered, and stunk nigh to death. Clear out the
house, and sweep it, and sprinkle chloride uv lime; and sich, all
over it. Shut down them Southern windows, and open those on the
North, East, and West sides. I want a snuff uv fresh air, for
I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this pint I awoke, and found myself, not in the White House,
but on the steps thereof, cold and shiverin. In my pocket wuz the
papers wich didn&rsquo;t get me the post orifis I wuz seekin, and
in my mind wuz chaotic confusion. Wuz the dream prophetic, or wuz
it merely a vagary uv the mind, wich, wen loosed from its clay,
sores off onto its own hook, without any restraint. Is the giant
Republican actually dead, or is he in a trance? Will it arise, and
scatter them ez hez appinted themselves administrators uv its
estate, and wich are beginnin to divide the assets, or will he stay
ded? Wood, oh wood, that I knowed!</p>

April 1, 1866.</p>
<p>Charles Sumner is not a very popular man in this section uv
Kentucky; on the contrary, quite the reverse. He is known here ez
an Ablishnist; ez one who is a chief supporter uv that hidjus
sin&mdash;the infidelity, I may say, for a man may ez well deny the
whole Bible ez to cast discredit upon Onesimus, Hagar, and Ham,
onto wich the whole system uv Afrikin slavery rests&mdash;the
origenator, therefore, uv the infidle beleef that Slavery is not uv
divine origin, wich, judgin from the experience uv the last five
years, appears to be gainin ground in the North. He is not,
therefore, popular in this region.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page113" name=
"page113"></a>113</span>Yisterday I attendid a tea party at Deekin
Pogram&rsquo;s, to wich the elite uv the Corners wuz present,
incloodin an Illinoy store-keeper uv the name uv Pollock, wich hed
bin invited because the Deekin hed, some three months ago, bought a
bill uv goods uv him on ninety days&rsquo; time, and wantid an
extension.</p>
<p>While at the table enjoyin the</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Cup wich cheers, but don&rsquo;t intoxicate very
much,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>ez Dryden hez it, tho I bleeve, to keep off chills, in this
country, they mix three and a half parts uv whiskey to one uv tea,
the name uv Sumner wuz mentioned.</p>
<p>Mrs. Pogram to-wunst remarked that she didn&rsquo;t want the
name uv that ojus creecher spoken at her table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; sed I, gratified at the ebulition.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hate him!&rdquo; sed she, spitefully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So do I,&rdquo; replied I; &ldquo;but what hev yoo agin
him, aside from his obnoxious political opinions?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t he marry a nigger?&rdquo; sed Mrs. P.,
triumphantly. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t he marry a nigger&mdash;a
full-blooded nigger? and hezn&rsquo;t he hed nineteen yaller
children, every one uv wich he compelled, agin their will, to marry
full-blooded niggers? Didn&rsquo;t he&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page114" name=
"page114"></a>114</span>&ldquo;Mrs. P.,&rdquo; sed this Illinoy
store-keeper, wich his name it wuz Pollock, &ldquo;do yoo object to
miscegenation?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Missee&mdash;what?&rdquo; replied she, struck all uv a
heap at the word.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miscegenation&mdash;amalgamation&mdash;marryin whites
with niggers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do I?&rdquo; retorted she; &ldquo;ketch a son uv mine
marryin a nigger! They are another race; they&rsquo;r beasts; and
who&rsquo;d marry em but jist sich men ez Sumner and them other
Ablishnists?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then permit me to ask,&rdquo; sed this Pollock, wich wuz
bound to kick up a muss, &ldquo;ef ther&rsquo;s any race uv pure
blood in this section uv Kentucky, wich is yaller?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! uv course not,&rdquo; sed Mrs. P.; &ldquo;them yaller
people is mulatters&mdash;half nigger, half white.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And them ez is quite white&mdash;not quite, but nearly
so&mdash;about the color uv a new saddle, like Jane, there,&rdquo;
sed he, pintin to a octoroon girl uv 18 wich used to belong to the
Deekin afore the isshooin uv the infernal proclamashen, &ldquo;like
Jane, there, wich is waitin on the Deekin, and&mdash;but, good
Lord!&rdquo; sed he, startin up like a tragedian.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wat!&rdquo; shouted the company, all startin up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothin,&rdquo; sed he: &ldquo;only, now that Jane&rsquo;s
face is <span class="pagenum"><a id="page115" name=
"page115"></a>115</span>in range with the Deekin&rsquo;s, wat a
wonderful resemblance! She hez the Pogram nose and ginral outline
uv face; not Mrs. P.&rsquo;s angularity, but the Deekin all over.
My deer sir,&rdquo; sed he, addressin the Deekin, &ldquo;ef she
wuzn&rsquo;t a quadroon, I shood say she looks enough like yoo to
be yoor daughter, by a first wife, I shood say, for she hez not, ez
I remarked, Mrs. P.&rsquo;s angularity and gineral boneinis; but uv
course, she bein a part nigger, the resemblance may be sat down
ez-a-very-remarkable-coincidence!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Deekin turned ez white ez a sheet, and Mrs. Pogram turned ez
red ez a biled lobster, from wich I inferred that there wuz trooth
in a rumor I had heerd about the Deekin and his wife hevin a
misunderstandin about a nigger woman and her baby, about 18 years
ago, wich resulted in his bein made bald-headed in less than a
minute, and the baby&rsquo;s mother being sold South. The Illinoy
store-keeper, uv the name uv Pollock, resoomed,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wuz about askin wat them niggers is ez is nearly
white?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, they&rsquo;r octoroons, or seven-eighths
white,&rdquo; sed Mrs. Pogram.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And no Kentuckian ever marries a nigger?&rdquo; inquired
the store-keeper, who I saw wuz pursooin his investigations
altogether too fur.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page116" name=
"page116"></a>116</span>&ldquo;Never!&rdquo; sed Mrs. Pogram;
&ldquo;we leave that to Ablishnists.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; sed this Pollock, who, I spect,
wuzn&rsquo;t half so innsent ez he let on, &ldquo;I see that yoo
hev no objection to mixin with the nigger, providin yoo don&rsquo;t
do it legally; that amalgamashen don&rsquo;t hurt nothin, pervidin
yoo temper it with adultery. Is that the idee, Mrs.
Pogram?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. P. wuz mad, and made no reply, and Pollock persood the
subjick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jane there, is, I take it, about one-eighth nigger. She
got her white blood from whites, uv course; and ez there coodent be
no marryin in the biznis, there is proof positive in her face that
the 8th commandment hez bin violated about four times somewhere in
this vicinity, or wherever her maternal ancestors, on her
mother&rsquo;s side, may hev resided. What do yoo think about it,
Deekin? Ez a Christian, woodent it be better to marry em than to
add a violation uv the commandment to the sin uv amalgamashen? It
wood redoose yoor load jest a half.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Deekin wuz too indignant to reply, and ez it involved a pint
altogether too hefty for his limited intelleck, I took it up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear sir,&rdquo; I remarked, &ldquo;yoo don&rsquo;t
make the proper distinction, or, rather, yoo don&rsquo;t appreciate
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page117" name=
"page117"></a>117</span>the subjick at all. The nigger here
sustains only one character with us,&mdash;that uv a inferior bein,
the slave uv the hawty Caucashen, uv whom we are the noblest
specimens; that is, the Deekin is, he bein a Southerner. I
unfortunately wuz born in the North, and am a hawty Caucashen only
by adoption. To marry a nigger wood be to destroy our idea uv
sooperiority, for we marry only our ekals. The intercourse with em,
the results uv wich yoo see indications, bein outside uv the pale
uv matrimony, is not, ez yoo wood suppose, the result uv unbrideled
licentiousnis, but is merely the assertion uv our superiority. When
the lordly Caucashen (uv whom the Deekin is wich) bids a daughter
uv Ham (wich, in the orginal Hebrew, signifies the hind-quarter uv
a hog) come to him, and she doth it not, he breaks her head, wich
inculcates obedience. One is only a slave indeed when he surrenders
all his individyooel rites. The female slave cannot be considered
ez entirely subdooed until she hez yielded to her owner everything.
To marry em wood be to elevate em; the intercourse common among us
is not a sin, it bein merely the assertion uv that superiority wich
we claim is founded on the Holy Scripter. See Onesimus, Hagar, and
Ham.&rdquo;</p>

uv our sooperiority; it&rsquo;s a dooty every white man owes to his

Caucashen. Niggers is niggers, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Noticin that Mrs. Pogram hedn&rsquo;t quite arrived at the
proper pitch uv self-sacrifice, I turned the discussion onto Sumner
agin, ez a subjick upon wich they cood all agree.</p>
<p>I learned that his father wuz a Dutch grocery-keeper, and his
mother an Irish washer-woman; that he run away from home at the
tender age of 8, after murderin, in cold blood, his grandparents,
one uv wich wuz a Jew and tother a Chinese; that he wuz apprenticed
to the shoemakin biznis, and hed cut the throat uv his boss and his
wife, and immersed the younger children into a biler uv scaldin
water, where they were found mostly dead seven hours afterward;
that he acquired wealth a sellin lottry tickets and brass clocks,
et settry. His servants wuz redoost Southern gentlemen wich he hed
swindled into his debt, and wich, under the laws uv Massychoosits,
coodent git away, and that his intimate friends and associates wuz
niggers, with wich <span class="pagenum"><a id="page119" name=
"page119"></a>119</span>he sot long at the festive board, and drunk
champane; that Lucresha Mott wuz his sister, Anna Dickinson his
daughter, Fred Douglas his half-brother, and that he kissed,
habitually, every nigger child he met, and frowned so severially
onto white children ez to throw em into spasms, and other items uv
information uv wich, livin in the North, I wuz ignorant. Ez I
remarked, he isn&rsquo;t popular down here, and, cood hardly be
elected to Congris from this Deestrick. The tea party broke up
shortly after, Pollock winkin at me villainously ez he left the
house, feelin good to think how he hed opened a old sore. That
Pollock needs watchin.</p>

April 2, 1866.</p>
<p>Kin it be? Is it troo, or is it not troo? Is Androo Johnson all
my fancy painted him, or is he still a heaven-defying persekooter
uv the Democratic Saints? That&rsquo;s wat I and some thousands uv
waitin souls wood go suthin handsome to know.</p>
<p>I confess I never quite lost faith in Androo.</p>
<p>Pro-slavery Democracy sticks to a man ez does the odor uv the
gentle skunk to clothes, and it is got rid uv only by the same
means, to-wit, buryin the victim thereof.</p>
<p>Androo started out to be a Moses, and he is one; but I think
he&rsquo;s changed his Israelites. I onst saw a woman skinnin live
eels, and I reproached her, saying,&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page121" name=
"page121"></a>121</span>&ldquo;Woman, why skinnest thou eels alive?
Doth it not pain em?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nary!&rdquo; retorted she. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve skinned em
this way for going on to 20 years, and they&rsquo;re used to
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Even so. The negroes hev bin in bondage so long that
they&rsquo;re used to it, and Androo feelin a call to continue in
the Moses biznes, hez, I hope, turned his attention to the
Dimocrisy. It&rsquo;s us he&rsquo;s a-goin to lead up out uv the
Egypt uv wretchedness we&rsquo;ve bin in for neerly five years;
it&rsquo;s <span class="sc">us</span> that&rsquo;s a-goin to quit
brick making without straw, and go up into the Canaan wich is
runnin with the milk and honey uv public patronage. We shel hev sum
fites: there&rsquo;s Amakelitish post masters and Phillistine
collectors to displace, but with a second Jaxon at our hed what can
we fear?</p>
<p>I feel to-night like a young colt. To me it seems ez though my
venerable locks, wich hangs scantily about my temples, hed grown
black agin, and that my youth was returnin. Ef I hed any notion uv
sooiside, them idea is dismist. I&rsquo;m young agin. Wat hez
worked this change? you ask. It&rsquo;s the proclamation declarin
the war at an end, and withdrawin from the Dimocratic States the
odious hirelins uv the tyrant Linkin, and the doin away uv that
terrible marshal law. That&rsquo;s wat&rsquo;s done it for me.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page122" name=
"page122"></a>122</span>Now I feel like sayin, with one uv old,
&ldquo;Mine eyes hev seed thy glory; let thy servant depart in
peace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We hev bin dooly subjoogated some time, and a waitin for this.
We wantid it, and longed for it ez the hart does for the water
course, and considerably more, onless the hart wuz thirsty in the
extreme. For now we are in the Yoonyun agin; we are under the
shadder uv that glorious old flag wich protects all men ceptin
niggers and ablishnists. The nigger is left to be adjustid by us,
who is to be governed by the laws wich control labor and capital.
Certenly he is&mdash;uv coarse. I saw two uv my neighbors adjustin
one last nite. They wuz doin it with a paddle, wich wuz bored full
uv holes. He didn&rsquo;t seem to enjoy it ez much ez they did. By
that proclamation our states are agin under their own control. Let
em go at wunst to work to destroy all the vestiges uv the crooel
war through wich they hev past. There aint no solgers now to
interfere, for the policy uv keepin soldiers in and among free
people is abhorrent to freedom and humanity. Go to work at wunst,
and build up the broken walls uv your Zion.</p>
<p>We must hev Peace and unanimity; and Peace cannot dwell among us
onless there&rsquo;s a oneness uv purpose and sentiment. To prokoor
this is yoor fust dooty. If there be among you them ez opposed
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page123" name=
"page123"></a>123</span>yoo doorin yoor late struggle for Rites,
hist em. Their presence is irritatin, and kin not be tolerated.
Ablishunism is as abhorrent now as ever, and the sooner yoo are rid
uv it the better. It is safe to assume that every man who opposed
the lately deceased confederacy is a Ablishnist.</p>
<p>The next step, and the most important, is to tear down the
nigger school houses and churches wich hev bin built here and
there, and kindly take the nigger by the ear, and lead him back to
his old quarters, wich is his normal position. The Yankee school
teachers sent here by Freedmen&rsquo;s Aid Societies shood properly
be hung for spreadin dissatisfaction and spellin books among the
niggers, but I wood advise mercy and consiliation. Tar and
featherin, with whippins, will perhaps do ez well, and will go to
show the world that our justice is tempered with charity; that we
kin be generous ez well ez just. Yoor Legislatures shood be
instantly called together, and proper laws for the government uv
the Freedmen should be passed. Slavery is abolisht, and the people
must live up to the requirements of the act in good faith. I
protest agin any violation uv good faith, but labor must be done,
for the skripter commands it, and our frail nature demands wat cant
be got without it. We don&rsquo;t like <span class="pagenum"><a id=
"page124" name="page124"></a>124</span>to do it, but shel skripter
be violated? Not at all. The nigger must do it hisself, not ez a
slave, for slavery is abolished, but ez a free man. Ethiopean
citizens uv Amerikin descent (wich is mulatters), and full-blooded
blacks, and all hevin in the veins a taint uv Afrikin blood, must
be restrained gently, and for their own good, I suggest laws ez
follows:&mdash;</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>They must never leave the plantation onto wich they are, when
this act goes into effect, without a pass from the employer, under
penalty uv bein shot.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They shel hev the privilege uv suein everybody uv their own
color, ef they kin give white bail for costs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They shel hev the full privilege uv bein sued the same ez white
folks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They shel be competent ez witnesses in cases in wich they are
not interested, but their testimony is to go for nothin ef it is
opposed by the testimony uv a white man or another nigger.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No nigger shel be allowed to buy or lease real estate outside uv
any incorporated city, town, or village.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No nigger shel be allowed to buy or lease real <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page125" name="page125"></a>125</span>estate
within any incorporated city, town, or village, except as
hereinafter provided for, to wit:&mdash;</p>
<p>He shel give notice uv his desires by publication for six
consecutive weeks in some noosepaper uv general circulation in sed
village, for wich publication he shel pay invariably in advance. He
shel then give bonds, in sich sums ez the mayor shel decide, that
neither he, nor any uv his ancestors, or descendants, or relations,
will ever become public charges, and will always behave themselves
with doo humility, the bondsmen to be white men and freeholders.
Then the mayor shel cause a election to be proclaimed, and if the
free white citizens shel vote &ldquo;yea&rdquo; unanimously, he
shel be allowed to buy or lease real estate. If there is a
dissenting vote, then he shel be put onto the chain gang for six
months for his impudence in makin sich a request.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Their wages shel be sich ez they and the employers shel mutually
agree; but that the negroes may not become luxurious and
effeminate, wich two things is vices wich goes to sap the
simplicity and strength uv a people, the sum shel never exceed $5
per month, but not less than enuff in all cases to buy him one soot
uv close per annum, wich the employer shel purchase hisself.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The master shell hev the privilege uv addin to <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page126" name="page126"></a>126</span>this code
sich other rules and regulations for their proper government ez may
strike him ez being good for em from time to time.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>These provisions sekure the nigger in all the rites wich kin
reasonably be asked for him, just elevated ez he is from slavery,
and thrown upon the world, ignorant of the dooties of his new
position and status. He is simple, and needs the guidin hand uv the
stronger race.</p>
<p>My hart is too full to make further suggestions. Organized into
a tabloo, with the constitooshun in one hand (wich beloved
instrument kivers a great deal of ground), a scar-bangled spanner
in the other, and a tramplin on a bloo coat wich I stript orf uv a
returned nigger solger wich wuz sick, I exultinly exclaim,
&ldquo;The Union ez it is is ez good ez the Union ez it wuz.
&rsquo;Ror!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Our wise men may make laws to keep him in his normal speer, but

April 26, 1866.</p>
<p>The work uv death is a goin on. The sakred precepts uv the Holy
Skripters is bein daily violated by an insane majority, who hev
substitooted their own noshens for the safe and pleasant
revelashens uv Holy Writ, and the practices of their fathers.</p>
<p>Cood Noah, when he cussed Ham, and declared that he shood be a
servant unto his brethren, hev foreseen how his cuss wood hev bin
disregarded in these degenerate days, he wood, I boldly assert (and
I make the assertion from wat I know uv the character uv that
eminent navigator), hev kep sober, and not cusst Ham at all. For
wat&rsquo;s the yoose uv sich a cuss ef it&rsquo;s to be removed
jist when you want it to stick? Hed it bin taken off afore cotton
wuz profitable, and afore the Southern people hed learned to
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page134" name=
"page134"></a>134</span>depend onto their labor, it wouldent hev
bin so bad, and they cood hev endoored it without murmurin. But,
alars! not only is the South in a state of abject cussitood, but
the Northern Dimocrasy is likewise.</p>
<p>The case stood thuswise: The South depended on the Nigger; and
the Northern politicians, like me, depended on the South. The
nigger wuz the foundashun upon wich the entire structur rested; and
now that he&rsquo;s knocked out, it falls.</p>
<p>I wuz in Washington the other day, and wuz a unwillin witnis uv
a scene wich filled me with unutterable disgust. The niggers wuz a
celebratin suthin connected with their onnatural removal from their
normal condishun, and wuz a paradin the streets with bands uv
music, and with banners and inscriptions. They hed the impudence to
dress up in good clothes,&mdash;clothes wich I cood not afford to
wear,&mdash;and three uv the impudent cusses hed the ashoorance to
go so far in their imitation of human beins ez to make speeches;
and to my horrer, the mass uv em hed ben so well trained by
somebody that they actily cheered, and ez near ez I cood make out
got in the applause at the right place, and all without the
assistance uv a indivijjle to commence applaudin <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page135" name="page135"></a>135</span>at the right
time, wich we hev generally found nessary at Dimmekratic
meetins.</p>
<p>Their inscripshuns wuz insultin. They hed em all spelt rite,
and; they wuz full uv aloosions to ekal rites, and onqualifyed
suffrage, and sich, planely showin that the poor, misguided
critters hed no idee that they wuz loaded down with a cuss, and
that becoz uv that cuss they hed no rites watever.</p>
<p>In Richmond I saw other evidences uv the terrible breakin down
uv the barriers wich Noah set up atween the races. I wuz sittin in
a hoss car, when a nigger hed the onparalleled asshoorence to enter
and set down. I remonstrated with the chattel, who laft in my
face.</p>
<p>Thus the old landmarks is bein removed, and thus the foundations
uv society is a bein broken up. I saw in Richmond fair wimmin who
hed, in olden times, never known wat labor wuz, a washin dishes,
and cookin their own vittles; and I saw men, who hed wunst lived
luxuriously on the labor uv a hundred niggers, now drivin drays,
and sellin dry goods and groceries, and sich, and my soul sunk
within me. Wuz the cuss a mistake? Wuz the nigger not the race that
wuz cussed? or has he becum so bleached, so lost in the white by
amalgamation, that there <span class="pagenum"><a id="page136"
name="page136"></a>136</span>ain&rsquo;t enough uv the black left
in each indivijjle for the cuss to hang to.</p>
<p>Andrew Johnson! in your hands rests our cause; on your ackshen
depends our weal or woe! Yoo, and yoo alone, kin remedy this. Wat
if a corrupt and radikle Congress does override your vetoes, and
legislate for these cuss-ridden people? Yoo hev yet a power wich
yoo must not hesitate to make em feel. Clear out the rump Congress;
declare our Southern brethren entitled to their seats, and see that
they hev em. The Dimocrisy uv the North, wich wuz latterly for
peece, are now fur war. They will sustain yoo. Reverse yoor
ackshen, and yoo kin attach em to yoo with hooks uv steel. There
ain&rsquo;t no risk in it&mdash;nary risk. Turn the Ablishnists out
uv the Post Offices, and replace em with Democrats; let it be
understood that yoo hev come back to your fust love, and no longer
abide in the tents uv Ablishunism,&mdash;and all will be well. Talk
less uv yoor policy, and put more uv it into acts. Combine Post
Offices with Policy, and proclaim that only he who sustains the
latter shel hev the former, and yoo kin depend on the entire
Democrisy North. We are waitin anxiously. From the South comes up
the cry, wich the North re&euml;kkoes.</p>

<p>The nigger hed become sassy and impudent, and denied that he wuz

<p>He sheltered hisself behind the Freedman&rsquo;s Burow, and the

<p class="address"><span class="sc">Confedrit &times;

(wich is in the Stait uv Kentucky),<br />
May 12, 1866.</p>
<p>The news from Memphis filled the soles uv the Dimocrisy uv
Kentucky with undilooted joy. There, at last, the Ethiopian wuz
taught that to him, at least, the spellin book is a seeled volume,
and that the gospel is not for him, save ez he gits it filtered
through a sound, constooshnel, Dimekratic preacher. We met at the
Corners last nite to jollify over the brave acts uv our Memphis
frends, and I wuz the speeker. I addressed them on the subjick uv
the nigger,&mdash;his wants, needs, and capacities,&mdash;a
subjick, permit me to state, I flatter myself I understand.</p>
<p>Probably no man in the Yoonited States hez <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page144" name="page144"></a>144</span>given the
nigger more study, or devoted more time to a pashent investigashen
uv this species uv the brute creashen, than the undersigned. I have
contemplated him sittin and standin, sleepin and wakin, at labor
and in idleness,&mdash;in every shape, in fact, ceptin ez a free
man, wich situashen is too disgustin for a proud Caucashen to
contemplate him; and when he ariz before my mind&rsquo;s eye in
that shape, I alluz turned shuddrin away.</p>
<p>I hed proceeded in my discourse with a flowin sale. It&rsquo;s
easy demonstratin anythin yoor awjence wants to beleeve, and wich
their interest lies in. For instants, I hev notist wicked men, who
wuz somewhat wedded to sin, genrally lean toward Universalism; men
heavily developed in the back uv the neck are easily convinst uv
the grand trooths uv free love; and them ez is too fond uv makin
money to rest on the seventh day, hev serious doubts ez to whether
the observance uv the Sabbath is bindin onto em. I, not likin to
work at all, am a firm beleever in slavery, and wood be firmer ef I
cood get start enuff to own a nigger.</p>
<p>I hed gone on and proved concloosively, from a comparison uv the
fizzikle structer uv the Afrikin and the Caucashen, that the nigger
wuz a beast, and not a human bein; and that, consekently, we hed a
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page145" name=
"page145"></a>145</span>perfeck rite to catch him, and tame him,
and yoose him ez we do other wild animals. Finishin this hed uv my
discourse, I glode easily into a history uv the flood; explained
how Noer got tite and cust Ham, condemnin him and his posterity to
serve his brethren forever, wich I insisted give us an indubitable
warranty deed to all uv em for all time.</p>
<p>I warmed up on this elokently. &ldquo;Behold, my brethren, the
beginnin uv Dimocrasy,&rdquo; I sed. &ldquo;Fust, the wine (which
wuz the antetype of our whisky) wuz the beginnin. Wine (or whisky)
wuz necessary to the foundation uv the party, and it wuz
forthcomin. But the thing was not complete. It did its work on
Noer, but yet there wuz a achin void. There was no <em>Nigger</em>
in the world, and without nigger there could be no Dimocracy. Ham,
my friends, wuz born a brother uv Japhet, and wuz like unto him,
and, uv course, could not be a slave. Whisky wuz the instrument to
bring him down; and it fetched him. Ham looked upon his father, and
was cust; and the void wuz filled. <span class="sc">There wuz
Nigger and whisky</span>, and upon them the foundashuns uv the
party wuz laid, broad and deep. Methinks, my brethren, when Ham
went out from the presence uv his father, black in the face ez the
ace uv spades (ef I may be allowed <span class="pagenum"><a id=
"page146" name="page146"></a>146</span>to yoose the expression),
bowin his back to the burdens Shem and Japhet piled onto him with
alacrity, that Democracy, then in the womb uv the future, kicked
lively, and clapped its hands. There wuz a nigger to enslave, and
whisky to bring men down to the pint uv enslavin him. There wuz
whisky to make men incapable uv labor; whisky to accompany horse
racin, and poker playin, and sich rational amoosements, and a
nigger cust especially that he mite sweat to furnish the means.
Observe the fitniss uv things. Bless the Lord, my brethren, for
whisky and the nigger; for, without em, there could be no
Dimocrisy, and yoor beloved speaker mite hev owned a farm in Noo
Jersey, and bin a votin the whig ticket to-day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this pint, a venerable old freedman, who wuz a sittin quietly
in the meetin, ariz, and asked ef he mite ask a question. Thinkin
what a splendid opportoonity there wood be uv demonstratin the
sooperiority uv the Caucashen over the Afrikin race, I answered
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; gladly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Mas&rsquo;r,&rdquo; sed the old imbecile, &ldquo;is
I a beest?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My venerable friend, there ain&rsquo;t nary doubt uv
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is my old woman a old beastesses, too?&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page147" name=
"page147"></a>147</span>&ldquo;Indubitably,&rdquo; replied I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And my children&mdash;is they little beasts and
beastesses?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Onquestionably.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Den a yaller feller ain&rsquo;t but a half a beast, is
he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My friend,&rdquo; sed I, &ldquo;that question
is&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold on,&rdquo; sed he; &ldquo;wat I wanted to git at is
dis: dere&rsquo;s a heap uv yaller fellers in dis section, whose
fadders must hev bin white men; and, ez der mudders wuz all
beastesses, I want to know whedder dar ain&rsquo;t no law in
Kentucky agin&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Put him out!&rdquo; &ldquo;Kill the black wretch!&rdquo;
shouted a majority uv them who hed bin the heaviest slave owners
under the good old patriarkle system, and they went for the old
reprobate. At this pint, a officer uv the Freedmen&rsquo;s Bureau,
who we hedn&rsquo;t observed, riz, and, bustin with laughter,
remarked that his venerable friend shood have a chance to be heerd.
We respeck that Burow, partikelerly ez the officers generally hev a
hundred or two bayonets within reech, and, chokin our wrath,
permitted ourselves to be further insulted by the cussed nigger,
who, grinnin from ear to ear, riz and perceeded.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page148" name=
"page148"></a>148</span>&ldquo;My white friends,&rdquo; sed he,
&ldquo;dar pears to be an objection to my reference to de subjeck
uv dis mixin with beasts, so I won&rsquo;t press de matter. But I
ask yoo, did Noer hev three sons?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He did,&rdquo; sed I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Berry good. Wuz dey all brudders?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uv course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ham come from the same fadder and mudder as the odder
two?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;C-e-r-t-i-n-l-y.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, den, it seems to me&mdash;not fully understandin
the skripters&mdash;dat if we is beasts and beastesses, dat you is
beasts and beastesses also, and dat, after all, we is
brudders.&rdquo; And the disgustin old wretch threw his arms around
my neck, and kissed me, callin me his &ldquo;long lost
brudder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The officer uv the Freedmen&rsquo;s Bureau laft vosiferously,
and so did a dozen or two soljers in the crowd likewise; and the
awjence slunk out without adjournin the meetin, one uv em remarkin,
audibly, that he had notised one thing, that Dimocrisy wuz
extremely weak whenever it undertook to defend itself with fax or
revelashun. For his part, he&rsquo;d done with argyment. He wanted
niggers, because he cood wallop em, and make em do his work without
payin em, wich he coodent do with white men.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page149" name=

<h4>To His Eggslency the Dispenser uv Post Orifices, Androo
Johnson, President uv the United States:</h4>
<p>In akordance with yoor esteemed request, dated the 25th, and
received this morning, I to-wunst proceeded to make doo enquiry ez
to the workin uv the Freedmen&rsquo;s Burow, and the condishun uv
the Afrikin citizens uv Amerikin descent in this vicinity. The fact
that a Ablishnist still holds the Post Orifice at the Corners (wich
place, by the way, I hev been solicited to accept), interfered
materially with the bizines I hed in hand. I to-wunst tooted the
horn, ez is the custom when we hev religious servis, and called my
congregashun together. They kum runnin in from the different
groceries; and here another difficulty ensood. The grosery keepers
wanted to know what we wuz a going to hev <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page151" name="page151"></a>151</span>meetin on
week days for? They wuz willin to shut up doorin meetin time on
Sundays, ez they respected the church, and it give em time to sweep
out the terbacker, et settery; but they&rsquo;d be d&mdash;&mdash;d
ef they wuz a goin to hev the people pulled away from their
nourishment on week days. I succeeded in pacifyin em, and went in
at wunst examinin the leadin citizens. Their testimony is ez
follows:&mdash;</p>
<h4>Captin Skelper</h4>
<p>Wuz a nigger owner afore the war, and durin the late fratrisidle
struggle wuz a captan in the confedrit servis. Wuz with Ginral
Forest at Fort Pillow. Hez hed much experence with niggers. Bleeves
em to be adapted to the climit uv Kentucky, and much more able to
stand the hot sun than the whites. When they wuz slaves, never
knowd em to refooze to work; know they alluz did work, becoz he
generally stood over em with a nigger whip. Since they hev bin
free, hez notist a change; not much uv a change, ontil the Nigger
Burow wuz establisht. Before that they&rsquo;d take sich wages ez
yoo chose to give em; since then the d&mdash;&mdash;d heathen will
stand out bout ez the white men do, and won&rsquo;t work at all
onless yoo meet their views, wich made a heap up trouble, and
materially retarded the develment <span class="pagenum"><a id=
"page152" name="page152"></a>152</span>uv the country. The Burow
hed corrupted the female niggers; ez they hed all bin legally
married by the Chaplins to the men they&rsquo;d lived with, and wuz
so sot on livin with em, that there&rsquo;s no yoose uv yoor tryin
to get a house wench unless yoo took her husband also. His wife wuz
now doin degradin work at home for want uv help. Strongly urged the
abrogashen uv the Burow, and the removal uv the Abolishun
Postmaster at the Corners.</p>
<h4>Deacon McGrath</h4>
<p>Wuz eggsamined. Wuz convinst in his own mind that the Afrikin
wuz now out uv his normal speer, and that the infernal Burow wuz at
the bottom uv it. The nigger, afore the Burow come around, wuz
docile and easly controlled. His boy Joe wuz wunst a model nigger.
He&rsquo;d get up every mornin at 4 A.M. (wich means in the
mornin), and work every day till after dark. Ez soon ez he wuz
emancipated, ez they called it, and the Burow come, I told him to
get up, one mornin; and he told me, impudently, that he&rsquo;d
concluded he woodent. I undertook to chastise him with a fence
stake, whereupon he sailed in, and whaled me; and the Burow, to
which I applied for redress, larft in my face. He left, and is now
draggin out a mizerable existence in Ohio, <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page153" name="page153"></a>153</span>on the
beggarly pittance uv two dollars a day, and my farm is runnin to
weeds. He conclooded by givin it ez his solemn opinion that he
never cood be reconciled to the Government so long ez the Burow wuz
tolerated, and that Ablishnist held the Post Orifis at the
Corners.</p>
<h4>Gineral Dinges</h4>
<p>Considered the Burow a inkubus upon the State. It interfered
between master and servant. Cood git along better ef the nigger wuz
left to the nateral laws wich regulates capital and labor. Tried to
keep his niggers, and did keep em the past summer till after the
crop wuz in, and then tried to settle with em for four dollars a
month, with sich deductions for food, sickness, and brakin tools,
et settry, ez wuz just. Brought the niggers, all uv em, in my debt,
and generously proposed to let em work it out choppin cord wood
doorin the winter. Hauled me up afore the Burow, and wuz forst to
pay em each $15 per month. Consider the Burow ez all that stands in
the way uv rekonstruction, though the removal uv the Ablishun
Postmaster at the Corners and the appintment uv a sound
constooshnel Dimekrat wood grately assist in conciliatin the
Kentucky mind.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page154" name=
"page154"></a>154</span>I tried to get some nigger testimony, but
cood elicit nothing worth while. One nigger, who spends the heft uv
his time at the Corners, wuz opposed to the Burow becoz it stopt
rations on him. And Lucy, a octoroon, who formerly belonged to, and
still resides with, Elder Gavitt (who is now absent ez a delegate
to a Southern religious convention at Louisville), testified that
the Burow &ldquo;wuz no grate shakes,&rdquo; becoz bein ez the
Elder wuz a widower, and the father uv all her children, and bein
she&rsquo;s a free woman, she askt the agent to make the Elder
marry her, and he woodn&rsquo;t do it. But sich evidence is
irrelevant, and I didn&rsquo;t consider it worth while botherin
yoor Eggslency with it. Both, however, strongly insisted on the
removal uv the Ablishun Postmaster at the Corners.</p>
<h4>Abslum Pettus</h4>
<p>Wuz convinst the Burow wuz agin the prosperity uv the State, and
wuz underminin the moral and physikle welfare uv the nigger. It
made him impudent. Hed sum uv em workin for him, and notist at
noons and nites he&rsquo;d find em with a spellin-book and a
reader. Didn&rsquo;t bleeve in readin. Coodent read hisself, but
hed a cousin wunst who learned; <span class="pagenum"><a id=
"page155" name="page155"></a>155</span>but ez soon ez he cood read
he moved off to Injeanny, quit the Democrisy, and becum a loathsum
Ablishnist. Heerd he wuz killed in the war, and served him rite.
Wanted to know what we wood do when the niggers cood all read.
Sposed we&rsquo;d hev to &rsquo;lect em to offis, ez the people
alluz selected sich, when they cood find em. Didn&rsquo;t bleeve in
nigger equality, and wuz in favor uv a imediate change in the post
orfice at the Corners.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Captin McSlather</span> thought things hed cum
to a sweet old pass, when a man coodn&rsquo;t lather a nigger
without bein hauled up afore a Burow.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Kurnel Pelter</span> thought ef yoor Eggsolency
cood witness the corupshun that eggsisted in the Burow, yoo&rsquo;d
make short work uv it. Why, he whipped a nigger hand more than he
ought, perhaps, and he died uv the injuries. It wuz a aggravatin
case. The nigger wuz sassy, and it cost three hundred and sixteen
dollars to pervide for his family. That infamous Burow made me pay
for their rashens all winter. He asked, indignantly, ef this wuz or
wuz not a free kentry into, wich such things wuz permitted. And the
Ablishen Postmaster at the Corners approved the tyranikle action.
He demanded his removal.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page156" name=
"page156"></a>156</span>I conceive it to be onnecessary to submit
further testimony. I know not what luck yoor other commissioners
may hev met with in takin testimony on this subjick; but in this
vicinity there can&rsquo;t be no doubt that there can&rsquo;t be
that love for the Government, without wich free instooshens
won&rsquo;t flourish to any alarmin extent, ontil this monster is
squelched. The testimony is unanimous, and them ez I hev eggsamined
are representative men.</p>
<p>You may hev notist, also, the singler unanimity with wich they
all bore testimony to the necessity uv a change in the Post Orifis
at the Corners. I endorse all they say on this question, considerin
that that change is ez necessary in the grate work uv pacifyin and
consiliation ez is the removal of the Burow. In case a change is
made, I would say, for your guidance, that I hev been warmly
solicited by my friends to accept the position, and to pacify em,
hev at last yielded a reluctant consent. The fact that I never
served in the Confederate army may be an objection; but, to offset
that, I voted for Vallandygum twice.</p>
<p>Ef possible, send me a pardon at the same time yoo send me my
commission ez Post Master; for, if the Post Offis don&rsquo;t pay,
I may want to run for <span class="pagenum"><a id="page157" name=

document would be essential to my success.</p>

wretched man, who stands charged with thus lowerin hisself, drunk,
and bring it hither. The Court desires to know for herself whether
it was really whisky. The pint is an important one for the Court to
know.</p>
<p>A wicked boy remarked that the pint wood be better onderstood by
the Court if it wuz a quart. The bottle wuz, however, brought, and
the Court, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page161" name=
"page161"></a>161</span>wich is me, wuz satisfied that it wuz
really and trooly whisky. Ez the refreshin flooid irrigated my
parched throat, I wished that trials based upon that bottle cood be
perpetooal.</p>
<p>I considered the case proved, and asked Brother Pogram what
palliation he hed to offer. I set before him the enormity uv the
crime, and showed him that he was by this course sappin the very
foundashun uv the Church and the Democratic party. Wat&rsquo;s the
use, I askt, uv my preachin agin nigger equality, so long ez my
Deekins practis it? I told him that Ham wuz cust by Noer, and wuz
condemned to be a servant unto his brethren&mdash;that he wuz an
inferior race, that the Dimocrisy wuz built upon that idea, and
that associatin with him in any shape that indicated equality, wuz
either puttin them up to our standard or lowrin ourselves to
theirn; in either case the result wuz fatal. I implored Brother
Pogram to make a clean breast uv it, confess his sin, and humbly
receeve sich punishment ez shood be awarded him, and go and sin no
more. &ldquo;Speak up, Brother Pogram,&rdquo; sez I, paternally,
and yet severely.</p>
<p>Brother Pogram, to my unspeakable relief, for he is the
wealthiest member of the congregashun, and one we darsn&rsquo;t
expel, replied,&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page162" name=
"page162"></a>162</span>&ldquo;That he <span class="sc">did</span>
drink with the nigger, and wat wuz more, he wuz justified in doin
it, for <span class="sc">the nigger paid for the
whisky</span>!!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But shoorly,&rdquo; I remarked, &ldquo;it wasn&rsquo;t
nessary to yoor purpose to come in with the nigger
arm-in-arm,&mdash;a attitood wich implies familiarity, ef not
affeckshun.&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>The Prisoner</em>.&mdash;The nigger and I hed bin pitchin
coppers for drinks, and I, possessin more akootnis, hed won. I took
the nigger by the arm, fearin that ef I let go uv him he&rsquo;d
dodge without payin. They are slippery.</p>
<p>Overjoyed, I clasped him around the neck, and to-wunst dismist
the charge as unfounded and frivolous.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My brethren,&rdquo; sez I, &ldquo;the action of Brother
Pogram is not only justifiable, but is commendable, and worthy of
imitashun. Ham wuz cust by Noer, and condemned by him to serve his
brethren. The nigger is the descendant of Ham, and we are the
descendants uv the brethren, and ef Noer hed a clear rite to cuss
one of his sons, and sell him out to the balance uv the boys for
all time, we hev ded wood on the nigger, for it is clear that he
wuz made to labor for us and minister to our wants. So it wuz, my
brethren, until an Ape, who hed power, interfered <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page163" name="page163"></a>163</span>and
delivered him out of our hand. Wat shel we do? Wat we cannot do by
force we must do by financeerin. We can&rsquo;t any longer
<em>compel</em> the nigger to furnish us the means, and therefore
in order to fulfil the skripter, we are justified in accomplishing
by our sooperior skill wat we used to do with whips and dorgs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The spectacle uv Brother Pogram&rsquo;s marchin into
Bascom&rsquo;s with that nigger wuz a sublime spectacle, and one
well calculated to cheer the heart uv the troo Dimekrat. He hed
vanquished him in an encounter where skill wuz required, thus
demonstratin the sooperiority uv the Anglo-Saxon mind&mdash;he led
him a captive, and made uv him a spoil.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wood, O wood that we all hed a nigger to play with for
drinks! The case is dismissed, the costs to be paid by the
complainant!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The walls uv our Zion is stronger than ever. This trial, ez it
resulted, is a new and strong abutment&mdash;a tall and strong
tower.</p>

June 22, 1866.</p>
<p>There wuz joy at the Corners when the Postmaster (who takes the
only paper wich comes to the office, ceptin a few wich comes to
some demoralized niggers who hev learned to read, and the officers
uv the Freedmen&rsquo;s Burow here) read to the crowd the news uv
the canin wich Rosso, wich is uv Kentucky, give Grinnell. It sent a
thrill uv joy through the State, wich ain&rsquo;t done thrillin
yet. Bustin out into nine harty cheers, we to-wunst organized a
meetin for the purpose uv expressin our feelins on the momentous
occasion. The bell wuz rung, the people gathered together, and I
wuz elected Chairman (they alluz elect me to preside becoz
I&rsquo;m bald-hedded; they think bald heads and dignity is
inseparable), and Deekin Pogram Secretary, <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page165" name="page165"></a>165</span>with 36
Vice-Presidents&mdash;one for each State. I made a short speech on
takin the chair, congratulatin em on the auspicious event wich
called us together. Whereupon a Committee on Resolutions wuz
appinted, wich, after a short absense, reported ez
follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Whereas, Genral Rosso, a native-born Kentuckian, and therefore a
gentleman, hevin got into a argument with a Iowa sheep-breeder;
and,</p>
<p>Whereas, hevin got the wust uv the argument, he dextrously
turned it into blackguardin; and,</p>
<p>Whereas, hevin got the wust uv the blackguardin, he remembered
the ancient usages uv the chivalrous sons uv the South, and caned
him; therefore, be it</p>
<p><em>Resolved</em>, That we, the Dimocrisy uv Confedrit &times;
Roads, wich is in the State uv Kentucky, hereby thank General Rosso
for his manly vindication uv the character uv Kentucky.</p>
<p><em>Resolved</em>, That we know not wich to admire the most; the
dashin Gineral&rsquo;s courage in bravin the public sentiment uv
the North, or his prudence in selectin the smallest and physically
weakest man in the House to demonstrate onto.</p>
<p><em>Resolved</em>, That ez Thad Stevens is 70 years uv age, and
lame, and hardly recovered from his fit uv <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page166" name="page166"></a>166</span>sickness, we
suggest that our beloved hero commence a argument with him, feelin
that so far ez the argument and blackguardin goes the result will
be the same, only so much more so ez to give him a good excuse for
killin him, wich wood be doin the South a servis indeed.</p>
<p><em>Resolved</em>, That the Dimocrisy uv Kentucky hevent felt so
good sence the Memphis riots.</p>
<p><em>Resolved</em>, That this manly act uv Gineral Rosso&rsquo;s
makes up and compensates the South for the outrage he inflicted
onto her when he jined the vandal host wich devastated her soil,
and that hereafter he shel be receeved with just the same
cordiality ez tho he had gone into the Confedrit instid uv the
Federal servis.</p>
<p><em>Resolved</em>, That the thanks uv the Dimocrisy are due the
bold, brave men who accompanied and stood by General Rosso in this
vindication uv the Southern spirit.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I put the affirmative, ez is the custom here, it bein the rool,
when the leaders want a thing to pass, never to call for the nays,
and it went through all right. Then I arose, and stated I hed
another resolution, wich I wished to offer, and I read
it:&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page167" name=
"page167"></a>167</span>&rdquo;<em>Resolved</em>, That in retainin
in the Post Offis, at the Corners, a Ablishnist, President Johnson
is&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this point Deekin Pogram interrupted me. He spozed this
meetin wuz called to congratulate Ginral Rosso, and wat wuz the
sense uv mixin up a paltry Post Offis with a matter uv so much
importance ez the canin uv a Ablishnist? It was clearly out uv
order.</p>
<p>I replied,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wood <em>yoo</em> be glad, or wood this congregashun be
glad, to hev me in the Post Orfis in the place uv that
Ablishnist?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Deekin replied that personally he wood. He had the highest
respect for my massive talents and my excellent qualities uv head
and heart, and besides, he thought probable, ef I got the Post
Orfis, he wood stand a chance uv gettin the nine dollars and
sixty-two cents borrowed money I owed him, and&mdash;</p>
<p>I called him to order at once.</p>
<p>Bascom, who keeps the grocery, and who furnishes me with likker
(wich I hev to take for my hair) on the strength uv remittances I
am to receeve, insisted on hearin the resolution ef it wood further
my gettin the Post Orfis, and so did the benevolent gentleman with
whom I board, and I resoomed,&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page168" name=
"page168"></a>168</span>&ldquo;I kin see a good reason for
incorporatin a resolooshun demandin a change in the Post Orfis into
the proceedins uv this meetin. There wood be, my friends,&rdquo;
sed I, &ldquo;no yoose uv sendin him a naked resolution demandin
this change, becoz he reseeves hundreds and tens uv hundreds uv
applications for offices every day; in fact, they pile in at sich a
rate that he never opens the half uv them. The Dimocrisy, my
brethren, are alive on this subject. Ef they are to support the
President, they want, and will hev, the post orifises, for uv what
use is it to support a man and pay yoor own expenses? It is plain
that the proceedins uv a post offis meetin wood never reach him,
but this, my brethren, goes up to him from the <span class=
"sc">people</span>, endorsin a supporter uv his policy, and ez it
will be the only one he hez reseeved, or will reseeve, he will read
it and read it through, and in the exultation he will feel at bein
endorsed by anybody, who doubts the result? The Post Orifis is
mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bascom, the grocery keeper, moved, excitedly, the adoption uv
the resolution. I suggested that I hed better read it, but he sed
it made no difference; he knew it wuz all rite. The benevolent and
confidin individooal I board with seconded the motion, and Deekin
Pogram supported it in a short speech, <span class="pagenum"><a id=
"page169" name="page169"></a>169</span>statin that he understood
that it wuz Brother Nasby&rsquo;s intention, ef he succeeded in
procoorin the position, to devote the first three and a half
years&rsquo; salary towards payin off the small indebtedness he hed
contracted sence he hed honored the town by residin in it. To all
uv wich I blandly smiled an assent, whereupon the resolution wuz
adopted yoonanimusly. Hevin lived here a little risin uv a year,
the vote wuz perfeckly yoonanimous.</p>

<p class="address"><span class="sc">Confedrit &times;

(wich is in the Stait uv Kentucky),<br />
July 6, 1866.</p>
<p>I preached last Sabbath, or rather, tried to, from the parable
of the Prodigal Son. We hed a splendid congregashun. I notice a
revival of the work in this part uv the Dimocratic vineyard wich
reely cheers me. The demonstrashun our friends made in Memphis, the
canin uv Grinnel by Rosso, and the call for a Johnson Convenshun in
Philadelphia, all, all hev conspired to comfort the souls uv the
Dimocrisy, and encourage em to renewed effort. It is bringing forth
fruit. Only last week five northern men were sent whirlin out of
this section. They dusted in the night to escape hangin, leavin
their goods as a prey for the righteous. Six niggers hev bin killed
and one Burow officer shot. Trooly there is everything to encourage
us.</p>
<p>The house wuz full. The weather wuz hot, and <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page171" name="page171"></a>171</span>the pleasant
incense uv mingled whiskey, tobacco, and snuff wich ariz wuz
grateful to me. The sun shone in on Deekin Pogram&rsquo;s face ez
he gently slept, and when the sun hits him square I kin alluz tell
wher he sets, even ef it is dark. He drinks apple-jack instead of
corn whiskey, and chaws fine cut tobacker instead uv plug, and
consekently when in the pulpit I kin distinguish the pecooliar
aroma uv his breath from those around him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My brethren,&rdquo; sed I, &ldquo;sich uv yoo ez hev
Bibles in yoor houses, kin get somebody to read yoo the parable to
wich I shel call yoor attention. A man, wunst upon a time, hed
sons, ez many men hev since, and wun uv em wuz a tough one. He left
his home and went into far countries, makin the old man shel out
his share uv the estate, and he lived high, jist, my brethren, ez
yoor boys do, or rather, did, when they went to Noo Orleans, in the
days when yoo hed a nigger or two wich yoo cood sell to supply em
with money. He played draw poker and faro; he drank fancy drinks,
and boarded at big hotels; and he follered after strange women,
wich&rsquo;ll bust a man quicker nor any one small sin the devil
hez yet invented, ez yoor pastor kin testify. Uv course, his pile
give out, and he got down, my friends, did this ingenuous yooth, to
rags and <span class="pagenum"><a id="page172" name=
"page172"></a>172</span>wretchedness, and ended in being an
overseer uv swine. What did he do? He ariz and went to his father,
and the old man saw him afar off, and went out to meet him, and
fell onto his neck, and give him a order for a soot of clothes and
a pair uv boots, and put a ring onto his finger, and made a feast,
killin for the purpose the fatted calf wich he hed saved for
another occasion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My friends, you kin find in the Skripter suthin
applicable to every occasion, and this parable fits the present
time like a ready-made coat. The South is the Prodigal Son. We went
out from our father&rsquo;s house on a expedition wich heznt proved
altogether a success. We spent our share uv the estate, and a
little more. We run through with our means, and hev cum down to
rags, and dirt, and filth, and hunger. We are, and hev bin some
time, a chawin husks. We run out after them twin harlots, Slavery
and State Rights, and they&rsquo;ve cleaned us out. Our pockets are
empty. No more doth the pleasant half-dollar jingle in sweet unison
agin its fellows. Our wallets is barren uv postal currency, and the
grocery-keepers mourn, and refuse to be comforted, becoz we are
not. We hev got to the husk stage uv our woe, and wood be tendin
hogs, ef the armies, wich past through these countries, hed left us
any. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page173" name=
"page173"></a>173</span>We hev kum back. In rags and dirt we hev
wended our way to Washington, and ask to be taken back. Now, why
don&rsquo;t our father, the Government, fulfil the Skripter? Why
don&rsquo;t it see us afar off, and run out to meet us? Why
don&rsquo;t it put onto us a purple robe? Where&rsquo;s the ring
for our finger, and the shoes for our feet? and where&rsquo;s the
fatted calf he ought to kill? My brethren, them Ablishnists is
worse than infiddles&mdash;while they preach the gospel they
won&rsquo;t practise it. For my part, I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this point a sargent, belongin to that infernal Burow, who
wuz in the awdience, with enough uv soldiers to make opposin uv him
unpleasant, sed he hed bin a sort uv an exhorter in his day, and
desired to say a word in explanation uv that parable, ez applicable
to the present time; and, sez he, &ldquo;ef I am interrupted,
remember I b&rsquo;long to the church military, wich is, just now,
the church triumphant.&rdquo; And cockin his musket he proceeded,
very much uninterrupted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The prodigal son,&rdquo; sez he, &ldquo;wuz received by
the old man with considerable doins, but, my worthy friends, he
went out decently. He didn&rsquo;t, ez soon ez he withdrawed from
the house, turn around and make war onto the old gentleman&mdash;he
didn&rsquo;t burn his house and barns, tear up his garden, burn his
fences, and <span class="pagenum"><a id="page174" name=
"page174"></a>174</span>knock down the balance uv the children. Not
any. He went away peaceably, a <em>misguided</em> good-for-nothin,
but yet a <em>peaceable</em> good-for-nothin. Secondly, he come
back uv his own akkord. The old man didn&rsquo;t go after him, and
fight for four years, at a cost uv half his substance, to subdue
him and bring him back, but when he hed run through his pile, and
squandered his share uv the estate, and got hungry, he came back
like a whipped dog.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My friends, let me draw a small parallel between these
cases.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Prodigal Son went out,&mdash;so did the
South,&mdash;thus farly the cases is alike.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Prodigal didn&rsquo;t steal nothin. The Confederacy
took everything it cood lay its hands on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Prodigal spent only what wuz his to spend. The
Confederacy spent not only all it stole, but all it cood borrer,
when it knowd its promises to pay wuzent worth the mizable paper
they wuz printed onto.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Prodigal, when he did come, come ez penitent ez the
consciousness that he hed made a fool uv hisself cood make him. The
Confederacy wuz whipped back, but it still swears hefty oaths that
it wuz right all the time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Prodigal didn&rsquo;t <em>demand</em> veal pot-pies,
and <span class="pagenum"><a id="page175" name=
"page175"></a>175</span>purple robes, and sich, but begged to be a
servant unto the more sensible brethren wich stayed. The South
comes back <em>demandin</em> office, uv wich the fatted calf, and
rings, and purple robes is typical, and considerably more share in
the government than it had before it kicked over the traces, and
went out like the lost tribes uv Israel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Spozn the Bible prodigal hed stopped his parient, and
remarked to him thus: &lsquo;I am willin to come back, on
conditions. Yoo must pay my debts&mdash;yoo must give me an ekal
share uv the farm with the other boys&mdash;yoo must treat me in
all respecks just ez ef I hadn&rsquo;t gone out, and&mdash;this is
essential&mdash;yoo must take with me all the sharpers who ruined
me, all the gamblers and thieves with whom I fell in while I wuz
away, and make them head men on the place; and above all, I hev
with me the two harlots wich wuz the prime cause of my ruin, and
they must hev eleven of the best rooms in the house, and must be
treated ez your daughters. To avoid displeasin the others,
I&rsquo;ll dress em in different clothes, but here they must stay.
Otherwise, I&rsquo;ll go out agin.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably the old gentleman wood hev become indignant, and
would hev remarked to him to go, and never let him see his
audacious face agin, or <span class="pagenum"><a id="page176" name=
"page176"></a>176</span>rather, he would hev strangled the harlots,
scattered the blacklegs, and choked the young sprout into
submission. Them&rsquo;s me. I am anxious to kill that fatted calf,
and am also anxious to put on yoo robes and shoes. But, alas! the
calf suffered from want uv attention so long doorin the late
misunderstandins that he&rsquo;s too poor&mdash;the robes wuz all
cut up into bloo kotes for the soljers we sent out to fetch you
in&mdash;the shoes they wore out, and the
rings&mdash;Jeff&rsquo;son Davis wears the only style we hev. When
you come back in good shape, yool find us ready to meet you; but
till then, chaw husks!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lookin around, this armed tyrant remarked that there would be no
more preaching that day, and sadly the congregation dispersed.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m heart sick. At every turn I make that Burow stares me
in the face, and counteracts my best endeavors. It&rsquo;s curious,
though, what different sermons kin be preached from the same text,
and it&rsquo;s also curious how quiet our folks listen to a
ablishnist who hez muskets to back him.</p>

Ablishunists, and consekently hed no idea uv the quantity a full

starter, to make the acquaintance uv his customers, he announced

sperit&mdash;in a more nobler sperit than the confidin and ignorant
man desired, in fact; for when we got through, in about 38 minits,

<p>Methought I wuz in Philadelphia, and the 14th uv August had
arriv. There wuz a glorious assemblage, ez Doolittle sed, uv the
brains and hearts uv the country, and I may add, ez I and Humphrey
Marshall wuz there, uv the bowels likewise. The Convenshun wuz
assemblin. There wuz Seward present, engineerin uv it. On one side
uv him I <span class="pagenum"><a id="page179" name=

wings, draped in white, and wearin a melonkoly look, with one hand
a layin on his shoulder, a tryin to take him out uv the hall, while
another bein, with wings like a bat, hed him by the nose, and wuz a
twistin uv him jest ez he desired. I notist that this last
mentioned bein hed hoofs, wich wuz split, and a tail wich he wuz
flirtin in great glee. The bein with the tail and hoofs whispered
suthin in Seward&rsquo;s ear, whereupon he moved that that eminent

chairman; upon wich the shadowy bein in white unfolded her wings,
and flew away, castin at William the most sorrowful look I ever
saw, the hoofed and tailed individooal laughin tremendous. The
Ex-President took the chair, and one Vice-President wuz appointed
from each State, ceptin Vermont and Massachoosits. My buzzum
swelled with emoshen ez that list wuz read; it wuz more like an
old-fashioned Democratic Convenshun than anything I hed heard for
five long years. I heard the honored names uv Toombs and Rhett,
Pryor and Lee, Slidell and Rosso, and Dandridge and Forrest; I
heard the names uv Craven and Pollard, Thompson and Forsyth, and I
felt like him uv old&mdash;&ldquo;Mine eyes hev seen thy glory, now

on each from the South and one from the North, wich wuz
consiliatin. I wuz put on the committee on credenshals, Randall,
the Postmaster-General, bein the Northern representative. We hed

items wich wuz specified), and all he wuz doin, and all he mite
do.</p>
<p><span class="sc">From the South</span>&mdash;all who cood show a
officer&rsquo;s commission in the late Confedrit army; all who had
receeved a pardon from A. Johnson, and all <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page181" name="page181"></a>181</span>who hed lost
their niggers in an unholy war, wich inclooded all present.</p>
<p>This decided upon, the work wuz done. The delegates took their
seats, and the grate work uv Reconstructin the Yoonyun commenced.
Garret Davis wanted to make a speech, and a hall wuz hired for him
in another part uv the city, and fifty or sixty German emigrants,
who coodent understand a word uv English, hired at a shillin an
hour to act ez audience. Five kegs uv lager beer, a flooid wich I
hev bin told Germans tie to, hed bin rolled in the hall, and most
uv em stayed seven hours and a half.</p>
<p>In the regler Hall there wuz a comminglin which wuz edifyin.
Doolittle wood make a motion, and Vallandigham wood second it.
Forrest made a speech, and Randall indorsed it. Seward and John
Morrissey were on the Committee on Resolutions, and Dick Taylor and
Cowan were occupyin one seat. The resolutions were brief and to the
pint. They resolved that,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Whereas, there hed bin a season uv unpleasantness in our
national history, wich, owin to circumstances over wich nobody hed
any control, extended over several periods uv ninety days each;
and</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page182" name=
"page182"></a>182</span>Whereas, the unpleasantness resulted from
the two sections viewin things each from its own stand-pint,
instead of viewin things from the other&rsquo;s stand-pint; and</p>
<p>Whereas, both parties wuz highly in the wrong, partikelerly the
North; and</p>
<p>Whereas, the South, with a magnanimity unknown in history, hed
thrown down her arms, and wuz ready to resoom her old position in
the Government&mdash;nay, more, to take more than her old share in
the trouble uv runnin the Government; therefore be it</p>
<p><em>Resolved</em>, That we are for the Yoonyun ez it wuz.</p>
<p><em>Resolved</em>, That the persistency uv a sectional Congress,
in continuin the unpleasantness wich hez to some extent disturbed
our system uv Government, in legistatin while eleven sovereign
States is unrepresented, is pizen.</p>
<p><em>Resolved</em>, That we view with alarm the manifest
determination uv Congress to centralize in theirselves the
law-makin power uv the Government, and we pledge our support to our
worthy Chief Magistrate, who is a second Jaxon, in his efforts to
check their centralizin schemes by vetoin all they may do.</p>
<p><em>Resolved</em>, That all traces uv the late onpleasantness
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page183" name=
"page183"></a>183</span>may be wiped out ez soon ez possible, we
demand uv Congress an appropriation for plowin over all the fields
on wich the citizens uv the two sections who wuz indoost by their
respective Governments, so-called, to carry muskets, cum together,
particklerly them on wich our Southern brethren got the worst uv
the disputes that ensood.</p>
<p><em>Resolved</em>, That Congress shood, ez soon ez it convenes,
change the names uv Murfreesboro&rsquo;, Gettysburg, Atlanta,
Vicksburg, et settry, to sich names ez Smithboro&rsquo;,
Brownsburg, Jonesburg, et settry, that the serious unpleasantnesses
wich occurred at them places may be remembered no more forever.</p>
<p><em>Resolved</em>, That the citizens uv the Southern States wich
lost their lives, and legs, and sich, in the late unpleasantnesses
wich hez bin referred to, ought to be placed on the pension rolls
the same ez the Northern citizens who suffered likewise; and that
the debt incurred by the South in upholdin things ez viewed from
its stand-pint, is entitled to be paid the same ez the debt
incurred by the North in upholdin things ez viewed from its
stand-pint.</p>
<p><em>Resolved</em>, That we are willin, for the sake uv harmony,
to admit that Sherman and Grant were, all things considered, worthy
uv bein ranked with Lee and Jackson.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page184" name=
"page184"></a>184</span><em>Resolved</em>, That the safety uv the
Government demands that sich ez took part in the late
unpleasantnis, from the Southern States, be to-wunst admitted to
Congress, and to the other posishens wich they yoost to ornament,
and that the more unpleasant they wuz doorin the trouble the more
they ought to be admitted.</p>
<p><em>Resolved</em>, That there shall be gushen confidences, we
freely forgive the honored Secretary uv State for the too free use
uv his little bell doorin the late unpleasantnis, believin that he
viewed things from his own stand-pint instead uv somebody
else&rsquo;s, wich alluz causes trouble.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At this pint His Eggslency, Andrew Johnson, supported by
Secretary Wells on the wun side and Vice-President Stephens on one
other, with Bukanan in front and Toombs behind, entered the hall.
Sich a cheering I never heerd. Hats wuz slung into the air, and
seats wuz torn up. Proudly they advanced up the aisle, treading, ez
they went, onto a portrait uv Linkin wich a enthusiastic
Connecticut delegate tore from the wall and throwd before em. They
took their position on the stage, Gen. Buell holdin over em a
Fedral flag, and Genral Henry A. Wise, <span class="pagenum"><a id=
"page185" name="page185"></a>185</span>uv Virginny, a Confedrit
flag, both wavin em to the music uv two bands; one a playin Dixie,
and the other Yankee Doodle.</p>
<p>At this pint methought the sperit uv Washinton floated into the
hall, and for a minnit contemplated the countenance uv President
Johnson. In my dreem I heerd him murmur, &ldquo;There wuz me, and
Adams, and Gefferson, and Monroe, and sich, and then cum Fillmore,
and Peerce, and Bookannon, and, good God! Johnson! Faugh!&rdquo;
and I notist that George spit ez tho&rsquo; suthin in his mouth
didn&rsquo;t taste well. In fact, the Father uv his country looked
sick, and spreadin his wings, the sperit moved out uv the hall,
shakin the sperit dust off uv his speritool boots ez he shot
thro&rsquo; the sky-lite.</p>
<p>There wuz then a blank in my dream. When I resoomed, I was at
the Post-offis Department the next mornin. The gullotin hed
commenced work, and the supporters uv the constitushun were
reseevin their commissions ez postmasters ez fast ez four hundred
clerks cood make em out. Ez I pressed forward, Randall hisself give
me mine. &ldquo;Take it, my venerable friend,&rdquo; sez he, with
tears a gushin down his cheeks; &ldquo;take it. No more shall that
Demokrat in your township who takes a paper <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page186" name="page186"></a>186</span>reseeve it
contaminated by the touch uv a Ablishin radical.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At last I hev it! Finally it come! After five weary trips to
Washington, after much weary waitin and much travail, I hev got it.
I am now Post Master at Confedrit &times; Roads, and am dooly
installed in my new position. Ef I ever hed any doubts ez to A.
Johnson bein a better man than Paul the Apossle, a look at my
commission removes it. If I ketch myself a feelin that he deserted
us onnecessarily five years ago, another look, and my resentment
softens into pity. Ef I doubt his Democrisy, I look at that blessed
commission, and am reassured, for a President who cood turn out a
wounded Federal soldier, and apoint sich a man ez <span class=
"sc">me</span>, must be above suspicion.</p>
<p>I felt it wuz coming two weeks ago. I received a <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page188" name="page188"></a>188</span>cirkler from
Randall, now my sooperior in offis, propoundin these
questions:&mdash;</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Do yoo hev the most implicit faith in Androo Johnson, in all
that he hez done, all that he is doin, and all he may hereafter
do?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do you bleeve that the Philadelphia Convenshun will be a
convocashen uv saints, all actuated by pure motives, and devoted to
the salvation uv our wunst happy, but now distractid country?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do yoo bleeve that, next to A. Johnson, Seward, Doolittle,
Cowan, and Randall are the four greatest, and purest, and bestest,
and self-sacrificinest, and honestest, and righteousist men that
this country hez ever prodoost?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Doo yoo bleeve that there is a partikelerly hot place reserved
in the next world for Trumbull, a hotter for Wade, and the hottest
for Sumner and Thad Stevens?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do yoo approve uv the canin uv Grinnell by Rosso?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do yoo consider the keepin out uv Congris eleven sovrin states a
unconstooshnel and unwarrantid assumption uv power by a secshnal
Congris?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do yoo bleeve the present Congris a rump, and that (eleven
states bein unrepresented) all their acts <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page189" name="page189"></a>189</span>are
unconstooshnel and illegal, ceptin them wich provides for payin
salaries?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do yoo bleeve that the Memphis and Noo Orleans unpleasantnesses
wuz brot about by the unholy machinashens uv them Radical
agitators, actin in conjunction with ignorant and besotted niggers,
to wreak their spite on the now loyal citizens uv those properly
reconstructed cities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Are yoo not satisfied that the African citizens uv Amerikin
descent kin be safely trusted to the operations uv the universal
law wich governs labor and capital?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Are yoo willin to contribute a reasonable per cent. uv yoor
salary to a fund to be used for the defeat uv objectionable
Congrismen in the disloyal states North?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>To all uv these inquiries I not only answered yes, but went
afore a Justis uv the Peace and took an affidavit to em, forwarded
it back, and my commission wuz forthwith sent to me.</p>
<p>There wuz a jubilee the nite it arriv. The news spread rapidly
through the four groceries uv the town, and sich anuther
spontaneous outbust uv joy I never witnessed.</p>

<p>SUPPORTERS OF &ldquo;MY POLICY&rdquo; IN PROCESSION.</p>
</div>
<p>The bells rung, and for an hour or two the <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page190" name="page190"></a>190</span>Corners wuz
in the wildest stait uv eggsitement. The citizens congratoolated
each other on the certainty uv the acceshun uv the President to the
Dimocrisy, and in their enthoosiasm five nigger families were
cleaned out, two uv em, one a male and the tother a female, wuz
killed. Then a perceshun wuz organized as follers:&mdash;</p>
<p>Two grocery keepers with bottles.</p>
<p>Deekin Pogram.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Me</span>, with my commishun pinned onto a
banner, and under it written, &ldquo;In this Sign we
Conker.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wagon with tabloo onto it: A nigger on the bottom boards,
Bascom, the grocery keeper, with one foot onto him, holdin a banner
inscribed, &ldquo;The Nigger where he oughter be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Citizen with bottle.</p>
<p>Deekin Pogram&rsquo;s daughter Mirandy in a attitood uv wallopin
a wench. Banner: &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve Regained our Rites.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Two citizens with bottles tryin to keep in perceshun.</p>
<p>Two more citizens, wich hed emptyd their bottles, fallin out by
the way side.</p>
<p>Citizens, two and two, with bottles.</p>
<p>Wagon, loaded with the books and furnitur uv a nigger skool, in
a stait uv wreck, with a ded nigger <span class="pagenum"><a id=
"page191" name="page191"></a>191</span>layin on top uv it, wich hed
bin captoored within the hour. Banner: &ldquo;My Policy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The perceshun mooved to the meetin hous, and Deekin Pogram takin
the Chair, a meetin wuz to wunst organized.</p>
<p>The Deekin remarked that this wuz the proudest moment uv his
life. He wuz gratified at the appintment uv his esteemed friend,
becoz he appreciated the noble qualities wich wuz so conspikuous
into him, and becoz his arduous services in the coz uv Dimokrisy
entitled him to the posishun. All these wuz aside uv and entirely
disconnected from the fact that thare wood now be a probability uv
his gittin back a little matter uv nine dollars and sixty-two cents
(&ldquo;Hear! hear!&rdquo;) wich he hed loaned him about eighteen
months ago, afore he had knowed him well, or larned to luv him. But
thare wuz anuther reason why he met to rejoyce to-nite. It showed
that A. Johnson meant bizness; that A. Johnson wuz troo to the
Dimokrasy, and that he hed fully made up his mind to hurl the bolts
uv offishl thunder wich he held in his Presidenshal hands at his
enemies, and to make fight in earnest; that he wuz goin to reward
his friends&mdash;them ez he cood trust. Our venerable
friend&rsquo;s bein put in condishun to pay the confidin residents
uv the Corners <span class="pagenum"><a id="page192" name=
"page192"></a>192</span>the little sums he owes them is a good
thing (&ldquo;Hear!&rdquo; &ldquo;Hear!&rdquo; &ldquo;Troo!&rdquo;
&ldquo;Troo!&rdquo; with singular unanimity from every man in the
bildin), but wat wuz sich considerashuns when compared to the grate
moral effect uv the decisive movement? (&ldquo;A d&mdash;&mdash;d
site!&rdquo; shouted one grocery keeper, and &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t
want no moral effect!&rdquo; cried another.) My friends, when the
news uv this bold step uv the President goes forth to the South,
the price uv Confedrit skript will go up, and the shootin uv
niggers will cease; for the redempshun uv the first I consider
ashoored, and the redoosin uv the latter to their normal condishun
I count ez good ez done.</p>
<p>Squire Gavitt remarked that he wuz too much overpowered with
emoshun to speak. For four years, nearly five, the only newspaper
wich come to that offis hed passed thro&rsquo; the polluted hands
uv a Ablishnist. He hed no partikler objecshun to the misguided
man, but he wuz a symbol uv tyranny, and so long ez he sot there,
he reminded em that they were wearin chains. Thank the Lord, that
day is over! The Corners is redeemed, the second Jaxson hez risin,
and struck off the shackles. He wood not allood to the trifle uv
twelve dollars and a half that he loaned the appintee some months
ago, knowin that it wood be paid out uv the first money&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page193" name=
"page193"></a>193</span>Bascom, the principal grocery keeper, rose,
and called the Squire to order. He wanted to know ef it wuz fair
play to talk sich talk. No man cood feel a more hart-felt
satisfaction at the appintment uv our honored friend than him,
showin, ez it did, that the President hed cut loose from
Ablishnism, wich he dispised, but he protestid agin the Squire
undertakin to git in his bill afore the rest hed a chance. Who
furnisht him his licker for eight months, and who hez the best rite
for the first dig at the proceeds uv the position? He wood
never&mdash;</p>
<p>The other three grocery keepers rose, when Deekin Pogram rooled
em all out uv order, and offered the followin
resolutions:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Whereas, the President hez, in a strikly constooshnel manner,
relieved this commoonity uv an offensive Ablishunist, appinted by
that abhorred tyrant Linkin, and appinted in his place a sound
constooshnel Demokrat&mdash;one whom to know is to lend; therefore,
be it</p>
<p><em>Resolved</em>, That we greet the President, and, ashoor him
uv our continyood support and confidence.</p>
<p><em>Resolved</em>, That we now consider the work uv
Reconstruction, so far ez this community is concerned, <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page194" name="page194"></a>194</span>completed,
and that we feel that we are wunst more restored to our proper
relations with the federal government.</p>
<p><em>Resolved</em>, That the glorious defence made by the loyal
Democracy uv Noo Orleans agin the combined conventioners and
niggers, shows that freemen kin not be conkered, and that white men
shel rule America.</p>
<p><em>Resolved</em>, That, on this happy occasion, we forgive the
Government for what we did, and cherish nary resentment agin
anybody.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The resolutions wuz adopted, and the meetin adjourned with three
cheers for Johnson and his policy.</p>
<p>Then came a scene. Every last one uv em hed come there with a
note made out for the amount I owed him at three months. Kindness
of heart is a weakness of mine, and I signed em all, feelin that ef
the mere fact of writin my name wood do em any good, it wood be
crooel in me to object to the little laber required. Bless their
innocent soles! they went away happy.</p>
<p>The next mornin I took possesshun uv the offis.</p>

August 14, 1866.</p>
<p>Peace is into me. I hev spent many happy periods in the course
uv a eventful life; but I never knowd what perfeck satisfaction wuz
till now. The first week I wuz married to my Looizer Jane it wuz
hevenly; for, independent uv the other blisses incident to the
married state, I beleeved that she wuz the undivided possessor uv a
farm, or ruther her father wuz, wich, on the old man&rsquo;s
decease, wood be hern, and the prospeck uv a lifetime with a
amiable, well-built woman, with a farm big enough to support me,
with prudence on her part, wuz bliss itself; and I enjoyed it with
a degree uv muchness rarely ekaled, until I found out that it wuz
kivered more deeply with mortgages than it wuz ever likely to be
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page197" name=
"page197"></a>197</span>with crops, and my dreem uv happiness
busted. Sweet ez wuz this week, it wuz misery condensed when
compared to the season I hev jest passed through.</p>
<p>I wuz a delegate to Philadelphia. I wuzn&rsquo;t elected nor
nothin, and hedn&rsquo;t any credentials; but the door uv the
wigwam I passed, nevertheless. The door-keeper wuz a Dimokrat, and
my breath helped me; my nose, wich reely blossoms like the lobster,
wuz uv yoose; but I spect my hevin a gray coat on, with a stand up
collar, with a brass star onto it, wuz wat finished the biznis. The
Southern delegates fought shy uv me; but the Northern ones, bless
their souls! the minit they saw the star on the collar uv my gray
coat, couldn&rsquo;t do enuff for me. They addressed me ez Kernel
and Gineral, and sed &ldquo;this wuz trooly an unmeritid
honor,&rdquo; and paid for my drinks; and I succeeded in borrowin a
hundred and twenty dollars of em the first day. I mite hev doubled
it; but the fellows wuz took in so easy that no financeerin wuz
required, and it really wuz no amoozment.</p>
<p>The Convenshun itself wuz the most affectinist gatherin I ever
witnist. I hed a seat beside Randall, who wuz a managin the
concern, and I cood see it all. The crowd rushed into the bildin,
and <span class="pagenum"><a id="page198" name=
"page198"></a>198</span>filled it, when Randall desired attention.
He bein the Postmaster General, every one of em dropped into his
seat ez though he hed bin shot, and there wuz the most perfeck
quiet I ever saw. Doolittle, who wuz the Cheerman, winked at
Randall, and nodded his head, when Randall announced that
<span class="sc">the delegates from South Karliny, and the
delegates from Massachoosits, wood enter arm in arm</span>! With a
slow and measured step they cum in; and, at a signal from Randall,
the cheerin commenst&mdash;and sich cheerin! Then Doolittle pulled
out his white hankercher, and applied it to his eyes; and every
delegate simultaneously pulled out a white hankercher, and applied
it to his eyes.</p>
<p>To me, this wuz the proudest moment uv my life; not that there
wuz anything partikilerly inspiritin in the scene afore me, for
there wuzzent. Orr, from South Caroliny, looked partikilerly
ashamed of hisself, ez though he wuz going thro a highly nessary,
but extremely disgustin, ceremony, and wuz determined to keep up a
stiff upper lip over it; and Couch looked up to Orr, ez though he
wuz afeerd uv him, and ez though he felt flattered by Orr&rsquo;s
condecension in walkin at all with sich a umble individjooal. But,
to my eyes, the scene wuz significant. I looked into the fucher,
and wat did I see, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page199" name=
"page199"></a>199</span>ez them two men&mdash;one sneekin, and
tother ashamed uv hisself&mdash;walked up that aisle? Wat did I
see? I saw the Democrisy restored to its normal condishun. I saw
the reunion uv the two wings. In fact, I saw the entire Dimokratic
bird reunited. The North, one wing, and the weakest; Kentucky, the
beak, sharp, hungry, and rapacious; South-west, the strong, active
wing; Virginny, the legs and claws; Ohio, the heart; Pennsylvania,
the stomach; South Caroliny, the tail feathers; and Noo Jersey, the
balance of the bird,&mdash;I saw these parts, for five years
dissevered, come together, holdin nigger in one claw, and Post
Offises in the other, sayin, &ldquo;Take em both together; they go
in lots.&rdquo; I saw the old Union&mdash;the bold, shivelrous
Southner a guidin, controllin, and directin the machine, and
assoomin to hisself the places uv honor, and the Dimokrat uv the
North follerin, like a puppy dog, at his heels, takin sich fat
things ez he cood snap up; the Southerner ashamed uv his
associations, but forced to yoose em; the Northerner uncomfortable
in his presence, but tied to him by self-interest. I saw a comin
back the good old times when thirty-four States met in convenshun,
and let eleven rule em; and ez I contemplated the scene, I too
wept, but it wuz in dead earnest.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page200" name=
"page200"></a>200</span>&ldquo;Wat are you blubberin for?&rdquo;
asked a enthusiastic delegate in front uv me, who wuz a swabbin his
eyes with a handkercher.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a Postmaster,&rdquo; sez I, &ldquo;and must do
my dooty in this crisis. Wat are you sheddin pearls for?&rdquo;
retorted I. &ldquo;Are you a Postmaster?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; sez he; &ldquo;but I hope to be;&rdquo; and he
swabbed away with renood vigger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wat&rsquo;s the matter with the eyes uv all the
delegates?&rdquo; sez I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve all got Post Offisis in em,&rdquo; sez he;
and he worked away faster than ever.</p>
<p>While gettin a fresh handkercher (wich I borrered from the hind
coat pocket uv a delegate near me, and wich, by the way, in my
delirious joy, I forgot to say anythin to him about it), I looked
over the Convenshun, and agin the teers welled up from my heart. My
sole wuz full and overflowin, and I slopped over at the eyes.
There, before me, sat that hero, Dick Taylor, and Cuth Bullitt; and
there wuz the Nelsons and Yeadons, and the representatives uv the
first families uv the South, and in <span class="sc">Philadelphia,
at a Convention</span>, with all the leadin Demokrats uv the North,
ceptin Vallandigham and Wood, and they wuz skulkin around within
call, with their watchful eyes on the perceedins. Here <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page201" name="page201"></a>201</span>is a
prospeck! Here is fatnis! The President into our confidence! The
Postmaster General a runnin the Convention! The bands a playin
Dixie and the Star Spangled Banner alternitly, so that nobody cood
complain uv partiality, or tell reely wich side the Convention wuz
on, or wich side it had been on in the past! Ah! my too susceptible
sole filled up agin; the teers started; but that vent wuznt enuff,
and I fell faintin onto the floor. Twenty or thirty Northern
delegates seed me fallin, and ketchin site uv the gray coat, with
the brass star onto it, rushed to ketch me; and they bore me out uv
the wigwam. Sed one, &ldquo;Wat a techin scene! overpowered by his
feelins.&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; sed another: &ldquo;he deserves
a apintment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t go back to the Convenshun, coz I knowd it
wan&rsquo;t no yoose; and besides, after all the teers that had
been shed,&mdash;the members wringin their handkerchers onto the
floor,&mdash;it wuz sloppy under foot. Conciliation and tenderness
gushed out uv em. I knowd it would be all right; it couldn&rsquo;t
be otherwise. There wuz bonds wich held the members together, and
prevented the possibility uv trouble. Johnson, hevin a ambition to
head a party, must hev a party to head. The Northern
delegashun&mdash;wich hed formerly actid with the
Ablishnists&mdash;couldn&rsquo;t <span class="pagenum"><a id=
"page202" name="page202"></a>202</span>do nothin without the
Democracy North; and both on em combined couldn&rsquo;t do nothin
without the Democracy South, The President cood depend on the
Democracy North, coz he holds the offices; the Democracy North cood
depend on the President, coz he must hev their votes. The President
cood depend on the Democracy South, coz they want him to make a
fight agin a Ablishen Congris, wich is a unconstooshnelly keepin uv
em out, and preventin em from wollopin their niggers; the Democracy
South cood depend on the President, coz he must hev their
Representatives in their seats to beat the Ablishnists in
Congris,&mdash;all cood depend on all, each cood depend on the
other, coz each faction, or ruther each stripe, hed its little
private axe to grind, wich it coodent do without the others to turn
the grind-stone.</p>
<p>The Southern delegates, some on em, wuznt so well pleased.
&ldquo;What in thunder,&rdquo; sed one uv em, &ldquo;did they mean
by pilin on the agony over the the Yanks we killed? by pledgin us
to give up the ijee uv seceshen, and by pledgin on us to pay the
Nashnel Yankee debt?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Sh!&rdquo; sed I; &ldquo;easy over the rough
places. My friend, they didn&rsquo;t mean it; or, ef they did,
<em>we</em> didn&rsquo;t. Is a oath so hard to break? Wood it
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page203" name=
"page203"></a>203</span>trouble that eminent patriot Breckenridge,
after all the times he swore to support the Constitution, to sware
to it wunst more? and wood it trouble him to break it any more than
it did in &rsquo;61? Nay, verily. Dismiss them gloomy thots.
Vallandigham wuz kicked out; but a thousand mules, and all uv em
old and experienced, cooden&rsquo;t kick him out uv our service.
Doolittle talked Northern talk, coz it&rsquo;s a habit he got into
doorin the war; but he&rsquo;ll git over it. Raymond will be on our
side this year, certain, for last year he was agin us; and by the
time he is ready to turn agin, he&rsquo;ll be worn to so small a
pint that he won&rsquo;t be worth hevin; and the Democrisy uv the
North wuz alluz ourn, and ef they wuzzent, the offices Johnson hez
in reserve will draw em like lode stun.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My deer sir, I wunst knowd a Irishman, who wuz sense
killed in a Fenian raid, employed as a artist in well diggin. It
wuz his lot to go to the bottom uv the excavation and load the
buckets with earth. The dinner horn sounded, and he, with the
alacrity characteristic uv the race, sprang into the bucket, and
told em to hist away; and they histed. But ez they histed, they
amoozed themselves a droppin earth onto him. &lsquo;Shtop!&rsquo;
sed he; but they didn&rsquo;t. &lsquo;Shtop!&rsquo; sed he,
&lsquo;or, be gorra! I&rsquo;ll cut the rope.&rsquo; <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page204" name="page204"></a>204</span>My dear sir,
Randall, and Doolittle, and Seward, and Johnson are a histin us out
uv the pit we fell into in 1860. Their little talk about debts, and
slavery, and sich, is the earth they&rsquo;re droppin onto us for
fun; but shel we, like ijeots, cut the rope? Nary! Let em hist; and
when we&rsquo;re safe out, and on solid ground, we kin, ef we
desire, turn and chuck em into the hole.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All went off satisfied: the Northern men, for they carried home
with em their commishuns; I, feelin that my Post office wuz sekoor;
for ef, with the show we&rsquo;ve got, we can&rsquo;t re&euml;lect
Johnson, the glory uv the Democracy hez departed indeed.</p>

who went a Pleasuring and came Home with nothing but the Necks of
His Bottles: by His Chaplain.&mdash;From Washington to Detroit.</p>
<p class="address"><span class="sc">At the Biddle
House</span><br />
(wich is in Detroit, Michigan),<br />
September the 4th, 1866.</p>
<p>Step by step I am assendin the ladder uv fame; step by step I am
climbin to a proud eminence. Three weeks ago I wuz summoned to
Washinton by that eminently grate and good man, Androo Johnson, to
attend a consultation ez to the proposed Western tour, wich wuz to
be undertaken for the purpose uv arousin the masses uv the West to
a sence uv the danger wich wuz threatnin uv em in case they
persisted in centralizin the power uv the Government into the hands
uv a Congress, instid uv diffusin it throughout the hands uv one
man, wich is Johnson. I got there too late to take part in the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page206" name=
"page206"></a>206</span>first uv the discussion. When I arrove they
hed everything settled cepting the appintment uv a Chaplain for the
excursion. The President insisted upon my fillin that position, but
Seward objected. He wanted Beecher, but Johnson wuz inflexibly agin
him. &ldquo;I am determined,&rdquo; sez he, &ldquo;to carry out my
policy, but I hev some bowels left. Beecher hez done enuff already,
considerin the pay he got. No, no! he shel be spared this trip;
indeed he shel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very good,&rdquo; said Seward; &ldquo;but at least find
some clergyman who endorses us without hevin P.M. to his honored
name. It wood look better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know it wood,&rdquo; replied Johnson; &ldquo;but where
kin we find sich a one? I hev swung around the entire circle, and
heven&rsquo;t ez yet seen him. Nasby it must be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There wuz then a lively discussion ez to the propriety, before
the procession started, of removin all the Federal offis-holders on
the proposed route, and appintin men who beleeved in us (Johnson,
Beecher, and Me), that we might be shoor uv a sootable recepshun at
each pint at wich we wuz to stop. The Annointed wuz in favor uv it.
Sez he, &ldquo;Them ez won&rsquo;t support my polisy shan&rsquo;t
eat my bread and butter.&rdquo; Randall and Doolittle chimed in,
for it&rsquo;s <span class="pagenum"><a id="page207" name=
"page207"></a>207</span>got to be a part of their religion to
assent to whatever the President sez, but I mildly protested. I owe
a duty to the party, and I am determined to do it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Most High,&rdquo; sez I, &ldquo;a settin hen wich is lazy
makes no fuss; cut its head off, and it flops about, for a while,
lively. Lincoln&rsquo;s office-holders are settin hens. They
don&rsquo;t like yoo nor yoor policy, but while they are on their
nests, they will keep moderitly quiet. Cut off their heads, and
they will spurt their blood in your face. Ez to bein enshoord of a
reception at each point, you need fear nothin. Calkerlatin
moderately, there are at least twenty-five or thirty patriots who
feel a call for every offis in your disposal. So long, Yoor
Highnis, ez them offisis is held just where they kin see em, and
they don&rsquo;t know wich is to git em, yoo may depend upon the
entire enthoosiasm uv each, individyooally and collectively. In
short, ef there&rsquo;s 4 offises in a town, and yoo make the
appointments, yoo hev sekoored 4 supporters; till yoo make the
appointments yoo hev the hundred who expect to get em.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The President agreed with me that until after the trip the
gullotine shood stop.</p>
<p>Secretary Seward sejested that a clean shirt wood improve my
personal appearance, and akkordingly <span class="pagenum"><a id=
"page208" name="page208"></a>208</span>a cirkular wuz sent to the
clerks in the Departments, assessin em for that purpose. Sich uv em
ez refoosed to contribute their quota wuz instantly dismissed for
disloyalty.</p>
<p>At last we started, and I must say we wuz got up in a highly
conciliatory style. Every wun of the civilians uv the party wore
buzzum pins, et settry, wich wuz presented to em by the Southern
delegates to the Philadelphia Convention, wich wuz made uv the
bones uv Federal soldiers wich hed fallen at various battles. Sum
uv em were partiklerly valuable ez anteeks, hevin bin made from the
bones uv the fust soldiers who fell at Bull Run.</p>
<p>The Noo York recepshun wuz a gay affair. I never saw His
Imperial Highness in better spirits, and he delivered his speech to
better advantage than I ever heard him do it before, and I bleeve
I&rsquo;ve heard it a hundred times. We left Noo York sadly. Even
now, ez I write, the remembrance uv that perceshun, the
recollection uv that banquet, lingers around me, and the taste uv
them wines is still in my mouth. But we hed to go. We hed a mishn
to perform, and we put ourselves on a steamboat and started.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Albany</span>.&mdash;There wuz a immense crowd,
but the Czar uv all the Amerikas didn&rsquo;t get orf his speech
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page209" name=
"page209"></a>209</span>here. The Governor welcomed him, but he
welcomed him ez the Cheef Magistrate uv the nashen, and happened to
drop in Lincoln&rsquo;s name. That struck a chill over the party,
and the President got out uv it ez soon ez possible. Bein reseeved
ez Chief Magistrate, and not ez the great Pacificator, ain&rsquo;t
His Eggslency&rsquo;s best holt. It wuz unkind uv Governor Fenton
to do it. If he takes the papers, he must know that His Mightiness
ain&rsquo;t got but one speech, and he ought to hev made sich a
reception ez wood hev enabled him to hev got it off. We shook the
dust off uv our feet, and left Albany in disgust.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Skenactady</span>.&mdash;The people uv this
delightfull little village wuz awake when the Imperial train
arrived. The changes hadn&rsquo;t bin made in the offices here, and
consekently there wuz a splendid recepshun. I didn&rsquo;t suppose
there wuz so many patriots along the Mohawk. I wuz pinted out by
sum one ez the President&rsquo;s private adviser&mdash;a sort uv
private Secretary uv State; and after the train started, I found
jest 211 petitions for the Post Offis in Skenaktedy in my side coat
pocket, wich the patriots who hed hurrahed so vocifferously hed
dexterously deposited there. The incident wuz a movin one.
&ldquo;Thank God!&rdquo; thought I. &ldquo;So long ez we hev
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page210" name=
"page210"></a>210</span>the post offiees to give, we kin alluz hev
a party.&rdquo; The Sultan swung around the cirkle wunst here, and
leaving the Constooshun in their hands, the train moved off.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Utica</span>.&mdash;The President spoke here
with greater warmth, and jerked more originality than I hed before
observed. He introdoost here the remark that he didn&rsquo;t come
to make a speech; that he wuz goin to shed a tear over the tomb uv
Douglas; that, in swingin around the circle, he hed fought traitors
on all sides uv it, but that he felt safe. He shood leave the
Constooshn in their hands, and ef a martyr wuz wanted, he wuz ready
to die with neetness and dispatch.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Rome</span>.&mdash;Here we hed a splendid
recepshun, and I never heard His Majesty speek more felicitously.
He menshuned to the audience that he hed swung around the Southern
side uv the cirkle, and wuz now swingin around the Northern side uv
it, and that he wuz fightin traitors on all sides. He left the
Constitooshun in their hands, and bid em good bye. I received at
this pint only 130 petitions for the post office, wich I took ez a
bad omen for the comin election.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Lockport</span>.&mdash;The President is
improvin wonderfully. He rises with the occasion. At this pint he
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page211" name=
"page211"></a>211</span>mentioned that he wuz sot on savin the
country wich hed honored him. Ez for himself, his ambishn wuz more
than satisfied. He hed bin Alderman, Member uv the Legislacher,
Congressman, Senator, Military Governor, Vice-President, and
President. He hed swung around the entire circle uv offises, and
all he wanted now wuz to heal the wounds uv the nashen. He felt
safe in leavin the Constooshn in their hands. Ez he swung around
the cirkle&mdash;</p>
<p>At this pint I interrupted him. I told him that he hed swung
around the cirkle wunst in this town, and ez yooseful ez the phrase
wuz, it might spile by too much yoose.</p>
<p>At Cleveland we begun to get into hot water. Here is the post to
which the devil uv Ablishnism is chained, and his chain is long
enough to let him rage over neerly the whole State. I am pained to
state that the President wuzn&rsquo;t treated here with the respeck
due his station. He commenst deliverin his speech, but wuz made the
subjeck uv ribald laffture. Skasely hed he got to the pint uv
swingin around the cirkle, when a foul-mouthed nigger-lover yelled
&ldquo;Veto!&rdquo; and another vocifferated &ldquo;Noo
Orleens!&rdquo; and another remarked &ldquo;Memphis!&rdquo; and one
after another interruption occurred until His Highness wuz
completely turned off the track, and got wild. <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page212" name="page212"></a>212</span>He forgot
his speech, and struck out crazy, but the starch wuz out uv him,
and he wuz worsted. Grant, wich we hed taken along to draw the
crowds, played dirt on us here, and stepped onto a boat for
Detroit, leavin us only Farragut ez a attraction, who tried twice
to git away ditto, but wuz timely prevented. The President
recovered his ekanimity, and swung around the cirkle wunst, and
leavin the Constooshn in their hands, retired.</p>
<p>At the next pint we wuz astounded at seein but one man at the
station. He wuz dressed with a sash over his shoulder, and wuz
wavin a flag with wun hand, firin a saloot with a revolver with the
other, and playin &ldquo;Hail to the Chief!&rdquo; on a mouth
organ, all to wunst.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who are you, my gentle friend?&rdquo; sez I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m the newly-appinted Postmaster, sir,&rdquo; sez
he. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a perceshun a waitin here to do honor to our
Cheef Magistrate, all alone, sir. There wuz twenty Johnsonians in
this hamlet, sir; but when the commishn came for me, the other
nineteen wuz soured, and sed they didn&rsquo;t care a d&mdash;n for
him nor his policy, sir. Where is the President?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Androo wuz a goin to swing around the cirkle for this one man,
and leave the Constooshn in his hands, but Seward checked him.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page213" name=
"page213"></a>213</span>At Fremont we hed a handsome recepshun, for
the offises hevn&rsquo;t bin changed there, but Toledo didn&rsquo;t
do so well. The crowd didn&rsquo;t cheer Androo much, but when
Farragut was trotted out they gave him a rouser, wich wuz anything
but pleasin to the Cheef Magistrate uv this nashen, who bleeves in
bein respected.</p>
<p>Finally we reeched Detroit. This bein a Democratic city, the
President wuz hisself agin. His speech here wuz wun uv rare merit.
He gathered together in one quiver all the sparklin arrows he had
used from Washington to this point, and shot em one by one. He
swung around the cirkle; he didn&rsquo;t come to make a speech; he
hed bin Alderman uv his native town; he mite hev been Dicktater,
but woodent; and ended with a poetickal cotashun wich I coodent
ketch, but wich, ez neer ez I cood understand, wuz,&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>&ldquo;Kum wun, kum all; this rock shel fly</p>
<p>From its firm base&mdash;in a pig&rsquo;s eye.&rdquo;</p>

</div>
<p>Here we repose for the nite. To-morrow we start onward, and shel
continue swingin around the cirkle till we reach Chicago.</p>

September 11, 1866.</p>
<p>I am at home, and glad am I that I am at home. Here in Kentucky,
surrounded by Dimicrats, immersed a part of the time in my offishel
dooties, and the balance uv the time in whiskey, with the privilege
uv wallopin niggers, and the more inestimable and soothing
privilege uv assistin in mobbin uv Northern Ablishnists, who are
not yet all out uv the State, time passes pleasantly, and leaves no
vain regrets. I alluz go to bed nites, feeling that the day hez not
bin wasted.</p>
<p>From Detroit the Presidential cavalcade, or ez the infamous
Jacobin Radical party irrevelently term it, the menajery, proceeded
to Chicago. The recepshuns his Imperial Highniss received through
Michigan were flatterin in the extreme. I continue my diary:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page215" name=
"page215"></a>215</span><span class="sc">Ipslanty</span>.&mdash;At
this pint the President displayed that originality and fertility uv
imaginashun karacteristic uv him. The recepshun wuz grand. The
masses called for Grant, and His Highness promptly responded. He
asked em, ef he was Judis Iskariot who wuz the Saviour? Thad
Stevens? If so, then after swingin around the cirkle, and findin
traitors at both ends of the line, I leeve the 36 States with 36
stars onto em in yoor hands, and&mdash;</p>
<p>The train wuz off amid loud shouts uv &ldquo;Grant!
Grant!&rdquo; to wich the President responded by wavin his hat.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Ann Arbor</span>.&mdash;At this pint the train
moved in to the inspiring sounds uv a band playin &ldquo;Hale to
the Cheef,&rdquo; and vocifrous cries uv &ldquo;Grant!
Grant!&rdquo; His Majesty smilinly appeared and thanked em for the
demonstration. It was soothin, he remarked. The air their band wuz
playin, &ldquo;Hail to the Chief,&rdquo; wuz appropit, ez he wuz
Chief Magistrate uv the nashen, to wich posishen he hed reached,
hevin bin Alderman uv his native village, U.S. Senator, etsettry.
The crowd hollered &ldquo;Grant! Grant!&rdquo; and the President
thanked em for the demonstration. It showed him that the people wuz
with him in his efforts to close his eyes on a Union uv 36 States
and a flag uv 36 stars onto it. Ef I am a traitor, sed he,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page216" name=

I&rsquo;m swingin around the cirkle, I find Thad Stevens on the one
side and Jeff&rsquo; Davis on the&mdash;</p>
<p>The conductor cruelly startid the train, without givin him time
to finish.</p>
<p>The crowd proposed three cheers for Grant, and the President
waved his hat to em, sayin that he thanked em, showing as it did
that the people wuz with him.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Battle Creek</span>.&mdash;A large number was
assembled here, who, ez the train stopped, yelled &ldquo;Grant!
Grant!&rdquo; Affected to tears by the warmth uv the reception, the
President thanked em for this mark of confidence. Ef he ever hed
any doubts ez to the people&rsquo;s being with him, these doubts
wuz removed. He wood leave in their hands the flag and the Union uv
36 States, and the stars thereto appertaining. Ef he wuz a Joodis
Iskariot who wuz&mdash;</p>
<p>The crowd gave three hearty cheers for Grant ez the train moved
off, to wich the President responded by wavin his hat.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Kalamazoo</span>.&mdash;The offishels were on
hand at this pint, and so wuz the people&mdash;4 offishels and
several thousand people, which the latter greeted us with cheers
for Grant! Grant! The President responded, sayin, that in swingin
around the cirkle, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page217" name=
"page217"></a>217</span>he hed bin called Joodis Iskariot for
sacrificin uv hisself for the people! Who wuz the Saviour? Wuz Thad
Stevens? No! Then cleerly into yoor hands I leave the Constitution
uv 36 stars with 36 States onto em, intact and undissevered.</p>
<p>The offishels received the stars and States, and amid cheers for
Grant, for which the President thanked em, the train glode off
magestically.</p>
<p>And so on to Chicago, where we didn&rsquo;t get off our speech,
though from the manner in wich the people hollered Grant! Grant! we
felt cheered at realizin how much they wuz with us. His eminence
wanted to sling the 36 States and the flag with the stars at em,
but ez General Logan wuz there, ready to fling em back, it wuz
deemed highly prudent not to do it.</p>
<p>Here my trials commenst. At the Biddle House, in Detroit, the
nigger waiters showed how much a African kin be spiled by bein
free. <em>They hed the impudence to refoose to wait on us</em>, and
for a half hour the imperial stumick wuz forced to fast. This
alarmin manifestation uv negro malignancy alarmed His Eggsalency.
&ldquo;Thank God!&rdquo; sed he, &ldquo;that I vetoed the
Freedmen&rsquo;s Buroo Bill. I hev bin Alderman uv my native
town&mdash;I hev swung around the entire cirkle, but this I never
dreemed <span class="pagenum"><a id="page218" name=
"page218"></a>218</span>uv. What would they do if they hed their
rites?&rdquo; The insident made an impression onto him, and at
Chicago he resolved to trust em no longer. He ordered his meals to
his room, and sent for me. &ldquo;My friend,&rdquo; sed he,
&ldquo;taste evrything onto this table.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why? my liege,&rdquo; sed I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Niggers is cooks,&rdquo; sed he, &ldquo;and this food may
be pizoned. They hate me, for I ain&rsquo;t in the Moses bizness.
Taste, my friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But spozn,&rdquo; sed I, &ldquo;that it <em>shood</em> be
pizoned? Wat uv <em>my</em> bowels? My stomick is uv ez much valyoo
to me ez yourn is to yoo.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nasby,&rdquo; sez he, &ldquo;taste! Ef yoo die, who
mourns? Ef I die, who&rsquo;d swing around the cirkle? Who&rsquo;d
sling the flag and the 36 stars at the people, and who&rsquo;d
leave the Constooshn in their hands? The country demands the
sacrifice; and besides, ef yoo don&rsquo;t, off goes yoor offishl
head.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That last appele fetched me. Ruther than risk that offis
I&rsquo;d chaw striknine, for uv what akkount is a Dimokrat, who
hez wunst tasted the sweets uv place, and is ousted? And from
Chicago on I wuz forced to taste his food and likker&mdash;to act
ez a sort uv a litenin-rod to shed off the vengeance uv the nigger
waiters. I wood taste uv every dish <span class="pagenum"><a id=
"page219" name="page219"></a>219</span>and drink from each bottle,
and ef I didn&rsquo;t swell up and bust in 15 minits His serene
Highness wood take hold. I suffered several deaths. I resoom my
diary:</p>
<p><span class="sc">Joliet</span>.&mdash;The crowd wuz immense. The
peasantry, ez the train approached, rent the air with shouts uv
&ldquo;Grant!&rdquo; &ldquo;Grant!&rdquo; His Potency, the
President, promptly acknowledged the compliment. He was sacrificin
hisself for them&mdash;who hed made greater sacrifices? He hed bin
Alderman uv his native town, and Vice-President; he wuz too modest
to make a speech; but ef he wuz Joodas Iskariot, who wuz the
Saviour? He hed swung around the cirkle, and hedn&rsquo;t found
none so far. He left in their hands the&mdash;</p>
<p>And so on, until near St. Louis, when we penetrated a Democratic
country, uv wich I informed his Majesty. &ldquo;How knowest
thou?&rdquo; sez he. &ldquo;Easy,&rdquo; sez I. &ldquo;I observe in
the crowds a large proportion uv red noses, and hats with the tops
off. I notice the houses unpainted, with pig pens in front ov em;
and what is more, I observe that crowds compliment yoo direct,

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page220" name=
"page220"></a>220</span>The President brisked up, and from this to
Indianapolis he spoke with a flooidity I never observed in him
before. I may say, to yoose a medikle term, that he had a
hemorrhage uv words. At the latter city our reception was the most
flatrin uv eny we have experienced. The people, when the President
appeared on the balcony uv the Bates House, yelled so vociferously
for Grant, that the President, when he stepped forward to
acknowledge the compliment, coodent be heard at all. He waved his
hat; and the more he waved it the more complimentary the crowd
became. &ldquo;Grant!&rdquo; &ldquo;Grant!&rdquo; they yelled; and
the more the President showed himself the more they yelled Grant,
until, overpowered by the warmth uv the recepshun, and unwillin to
expose his health, the President retired without slingin a speech
at em, but entirely satisfied that the people wuz with him.</p>
<p>The next mornin the office-holders uv the State, without the
people, assembled, and he made his regler speech to em, wich
appeared to be gratifyin to both him and them. The President does
not like to sleep with a undelivered speech on his mental stumick.
It gives him the nitemare.</p>
<p>Here I left the party, for a short time, that I mite go home and
attend to my official dooties. There is <span class=

Louisville to Washington.</p>
<p class="address"><span class="sc">White House, Washington,
D.C.</span>,<br />
September, 12, &rsquo;66.</p>
<p>I rejined the Presidenshel party at Looisville, and glad I am
that I did it at that pint. His Imperial Serenity hed bin pleased
ever sence he left Chicago, or rather sence he got near St. Loois,
for two-thirds uv Illinois wuz pizen, and Indianapolis wuz pizener.
From St. Loois the recepshuns wuz trooly corjel and even
enthoosiastic. We got out uv the region uv aristocrats, and hed
come down to the hard-fisted yomanry. I seed holes thro the hats uv
men; I seed wat mite be called the flag uv Democrisy wavin from
behind em, which, ez they genrally either had no coats at all, or
if any, they were roundabouts, wuz alluz in view. I saw wimen who
disdained stockins and dipped snuff, and I felt to home. I wuz
among Democracy. The cheerin <span class="pagenum"><a id="page223"
name="page223"></a>223</span>for Grant and Farragut closed ez we
got into them regions, and uv the vociferous crowds half uv em, the
younger ones, cheered Andrew Johnson, while the old veterans, them
whose noses wuz blossomin for the tomb, cheered for Andrew Jackson.
His Serenity smilinly acknowledged both, by makin a speech to em,
and wavin his hat.</p>
<p>With these preliminary remarks I resoom my diary:&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="sc">Louisville</span>.&mdash;There wuz a
magnificent demonstration here. His Imperial Majesty, who wuz in a
eggslent condition to make crowds large enough, remarked to me as
we wuz ridin through the streets: &ldquo;&rsquo;Splen &rsquo;splay!
&rsquo;Mor&rsquo;n ten &rsquo;unerd sousand
people&mdash;mor&rsquo;n ten million people&mdash;mor&rsquo;n ten
&rsquo;unerd million people&mdash;mor&rsquo;n ten &rsquo;unerd
sousand million people&mdash;and alluvum &rsquo;sporters my policy.
&rsquo;Rah for me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>His Majesty ondoubtedly eggsagerated towards the last; but it is
safe to put the throng down at a good many. That estimate is
entirely safe. There wuz the finest display uv banners and sich I
hev seen since we startid. The red white and red wuz displayed from
almost half the houses, ladies waved their handkerchiefs ez we
passed, and men cheered. A pleasin incident occurd here. I noticed
one gushin <span class="pagenum"><a id="page224" name=
"page224"></a>224</span>maiden uv thirty-seven wavin her
handkercher ez tho she was gettin so much per wave, and had rent to
pay that nite. I recognized her to wunst. When I wuz a citizen uv
Ohio, and wuz drafted into the service uv the United States, and
clothed in a bob-tailed blue coat, and hed a Oystran muskit put
into my unwillin hands, and forced to fite agin my brethren, our
regiment passed thro Looisville and stayed there some days. I wuz
walkin one afternoon, when I met this identical angel. She saw my
bloo kote, and enraged, spit in my face with sich energy that she
threw out uv her mouth a full sett uv false teeth. I returned em
gallantly, wiped my face with my handkercher, and vowed that
handkercher shood henceforth be kept sacred. It wuz; and when I
seed her wavin hern at our party, I wept like a Philadelphia
Convenshen. I stopped the carriage, met the patriotic female,
called her attention to the incident, and handed her my handkercher
which hed, four years before, wiped her spittle. The incident gave
new vigor to her arms, and from that time she waved two
handkerchers, and mine wuz one uv em. I narrated the insident to
the President, and he wept.</p>
<p>There wuz a large perceshen and a great variety of banners.
Among the most noticeable, wuz a <span class="pagenum"><a id=
"page225" name="page225"></a>225</span>company uv solgers uv the
late war, each with a leg off, dressed in the gray uniforms into
wich they hed been mustered out, with this motto: &ldquo;We are
willin to go the other leg for A. Jonson.&rdquo; Another company uv
solgers, who hed each lost an arm, carried this inscription:
&ldquo;What we didn&rsquo;t get by bullets, we shel get by
ballots.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The President cut down his speech jest one half here. In swingin
around the cirkle he omitted to menshen that he found traitors on
the Southern side uv it. But he left the constooshn in their hands
cheerfully.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Cincinnati</span>.&mdash;A very enthoosiastic
recepshen&mdash;continyood and loud cheers for Grant, wich the
President acknowledged. A unsophisticated Postmaster, who jined us
here, wanted to know why the people cheered for Grant instid uv the
President, to which His Highness answered that they wuz
considrit&mdash;they knew his modesty, and wanted to spare his
blushes. Another man, who wuz also unsophisticated, asked him,
confidenshelly, ef he didn&rsquo;t think there wuz a samenis in his
speeches, and that ef he didn&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;d do better to
give a greater variety. His Eggslency asked him how there
<em>cood</em> be more variety. &ldquo;At Cincinnati,&rdquo; sed he,
&ldquo;I observed the followin order:&mdash;</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page226" name=
"page226"></a>226</span>1. I swung around the cirkle.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I asked who wuz the Saviour ef I wuz Joodis Iskariot?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I left the Constitooshn, the 36 States, and the flag with 36
stars onto it, in their hands.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Now, at Columbus, I shel vary it thusly:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The Constitooshn, flag, and stars.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Joodis Iskariot biznis.</p>

<p>At Stoobenville, agin, ez follows:</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Swingin around the cirkle.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Constitooshn, flag, and stars.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>And so on. It&rsquo;s susceptible uv many changes. I thot uv
that when I writ that speech, and divided it up into sections on
purpose.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="sc">Johnstown, Pa.</span>&mdash;A bridge fell down,
onto wich wuz 400 voters, killin a dozen uv em. His Eggslency felt
releeved when heerin uv the axident, at bein asshoored that there
wuzn&rsquo;t wun uv his supporters on the bridge. He considered it
a speshl Providence. The condukter overheerd the remark, and
answered, that ef any uv his supporters wuz killed in that seckshun
they&rsquo;d have to import wun for the purpose.</p>

indivijjle who <span class="pagenum"><a id="page227" name=

much, fell on the President&rsquo;s neck, and wept, hailin him ez
the &ldquo;Preserver uv the Union.&rdquo; The President thanked him
for this spontaneous triboot, and left in his hands the
Constitooshun, the flag, and the appintment he desired.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Baltimore</span>.&mdash;There wuz a spontaneous
recepshun here, wich wuz gratifying to us. The perceshun wuz
immense, and the mottoes expressive. One division wuz headed by the
identikle indivijooel who fired the first shot at the Massachusetts
men in 1861. He is a ardent supporter uv President Johnson&rsquo;s
policy. One flag wuz capchered from a Injeany regiment at the first
Bull Run, at wich the President wept. &ldquo;Things is becomin
normal,&rdquo; sed he, &ldquo;when the people will stand that. Wat
love!&mdash;wat unity! The flags uv both secshuns, wich was lately
borne by foes, now minglin in the same proceshun, and all uv em
cheerin <span class="sc">me</span>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At last we arrived at Washinton, hevin swung entirely round the
cirkle, and found traitors North and South. The demonstrashen to
greet the President on his arrival was immense. The clerks in all
the departments wuz out (at least them ez wuzn&rsquo;t will wish
they hed bin, ez their names wuz all taken), the solgers on duty
wuz ordered out, and <span class="pagenum"><a id="page228" name=
"page228"></a>228</span>altogether it wuz the most spontaneous
exhibition I ever witnest. The Mayor made a speech. The President
asked if he was Joodis Iscariot who wuz the Saviour&mdash;told him
he had swung around the entire cirkle, and hed found traitors on
all sides uv it, though sence he left Cleveland, Chicago, and
Indianapolis he wuz satisfied there wuz the heft uv them in the
North; but be this ez it may, he left the Constooshn, and the 36
States, and the flag with 36 stars onto it, in his hands. He had
bin Alderman uv his native village, and Congressman, and United
States Senator, and Vice-President, and President, wich latter
circumstance he considered forchinit, but wuz, after all, an Humble
Indivij&rsquo;le. He didn&rsquo;t feel his oats much, and wood do
his dooty agin traitors North, ez well as agin his misguided
friends South.</p>

September 16, 1866.</p>
<p>I found my flock in a terrible state uv depression, at which,
when I wuz told the cause, I didn&rsquo;t wonder at. There wuz,
back of the Corners on the side hill, over towards Garrettstown,
about three quarters uv a mile this side of Abbott&rsquo;s grocery
(we estimate distance here from one grocery to another), five or
six families uv niggers. The males of this settlement had all been
in the Federal army ez soljers, and hed saved their pay, and
bounty, and sich, and hed bought uv a disgustid Confederate, who
proposed to find in Mexico that freedom which was denied him here,
and who, bein determined to leave the country, didn&rsquo;t care
who he sold his plantashen <span class="pagenum"><a id="page230"
name="page230"></a>230</span>to, so ez he got greenbax, three
hundred acres, wich they hed divided up, and built cabins onto em,
and wuz a cultivatin it. There wuz a store-keeper at the Corners
who come here from Illinoy, and who hed been so greedy uv gain and
so graspin ez to buy their prodoose uv em, and sell em sich
supplies ez they needed. These accursed sons and daughters of Ham
was a livin there in comfort. The thing was a gittin unendoorable.
They come to the Corners dressed in clothes without patches, and
white shirts, and hats on; and the females in dresses, and hoops
under em; in short, these apes hed assoomed so much uv the style uv
people that ef it hadn&rsquo;t bin for their black faces, they wood
have passed for folks.</p>
<p>Our people become indignant, and ez soon ez I returned, I was
requested to call a meetin to consider the matter, which I uv
course did.</p>
<p>The horn wuz tootid, and the entire Corners wuz assembled,
eggscepting the Illinoy store-keeper, who didn&rsquo;t attend to us
much. I stated briefly and elokently (I hev improved in public
speakin sense I heered His Serene Highness, Androo the I., all the
way from Washinton to Looisville), and asked the brethren to ease
their minds.</p>
<p>Squire Gavitt hed observed the progress uv them <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page231" name="page231"></a>231</span>niggers with
the most profoundest alarm. He hed noticed em comin to the Corners,
dressed better nor his family dressed, and sellin the produx uv
their land to that wretch&mdash;</p>
<p>At this point the Illinoy store-keeper come in, and the Squire
proceeded.</p>
<p>&mdash;he shood say Mr. Pollock, and he hed made inquiries, and
found that one family hed sold three hundred and seventy-five
dollars worth uv truck, this season, uv which they hed laid out for
clothes and books two hundred dollars, leavin em one hundred and
seventy-five dollars in cash, which was more money than he hed made
sense the accursed Linkin passed the emancipashen proclamation. And
what hed driv the iron into his soul wuz the fact that wun of them
niggers wuz <em>his</em> nigger. &ldquo;The money they hev,&rdquo;
pursood the Squire, &ldquo;is <span class="sc">my money</span>;
that man worth $1500 is my man; his wife is my woman; her children
my children&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a literal fact!&rdquo; shouted Joe Bigler, a
drunken, returned Confederate sojer; &ldquo;they hev yoor nose
eggsactly, and they&rsquo;re the meanest yaller brats in the
settlement.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This unhappy remark endid in a slite unpleasantness, wich
resultid in the Squire&rsquo;s bein carried out, minus one ear, and
his nose smashed. Joseph <span class="pagenum"><a id="page232"
name="page232"></a>232</span>remarked that he&rsquo;d wantid to git
at him ever sense he woodn&rsquo;t lend him a half dollar two
months ago. He was now satisfied, and hoped this little episode
woodn&rsquo;t mar the harmony uv the meetin.</p>
<p>Elder Smathers observed that he hed noticed with pain that them
niggers alluz hed money, and wuz alluz dresst well, while we, their
sooperiors, hed no money, and nothin to boast uv in the way uv
close. He wood say&mdash;</p>
<p>Pollock, the Illinoy store-keeper, put in. Ef the Elder wood
work ez them niggers wuz workin, and not loaf over half the time at
Bascom&rsquo;s grocery, he mite possibly hev a hull soot uv close,
and now and then a dollar in money. It wuz here, ez it wuz in all
strikly Dimekratic communities, the grocery keepers absorb all the
floatin capital, and&mdash;</p>
<p>He wuz not allowed to proceed. Bascom flung a chair at him, and
four or five uv his constitooents fell on him. He wuz carried out
for dead. Bascom remarked that he wuz for the utmost freedom uv
speech, but in the discussion uv a grate Constooshnel question, no
Illinoy Ablishnist shood put in his yawp. The patriotic remark wuz
cheered, but when Bascom ask&rsquo;t the whole meetin out to drink,
the applause wuz uproarious. Bascom alluz gets applause; he knows
how to move an audience.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page233" name=
"page233"></a>233</span>Deekin Pogram sed he&rsquo;d bore with them
niggers till his patience wuz gin out. He endoored it till last
Sunday. After service he felt pensive, ruther, and walked out
towards Garrettstown, meditatin, as he went, on the sermon he hed
listened to that mornin on the necessity uv the spread of the
Gospil. Mournin in sperit over the condition of the heathen, he
didn&rsquo;t notis where he wuz till he found hisself in the nigger
settlement, and in front uv one uv their houses. There he saw a
site wich paralyzed him. There wuz a nigger, wich wuz wunst his
nigger, wich Linkin deprived him uv, settin under his porch, and a
profanin the Holy Bible by teachin his child to read it! &ldquo;Kin
this be endoored?&rdquo; the Deekin asked.</p>
<p>Deekin Parkins sed he must bear his unworthy testimony agin
these disturbers. They hed&mdash;he knowd whereof he
spoke&mdash;hired a female woman from Massachusetts to teach their
children! He hed bin in their skool-room, and with his own eyes
witnest it.</p>
<p>Bascom, the grocery keeper, hed bin shocked at their conduct. He
wuz convinct that a nigger wuz a beast. They come to the Corners to
sell the produx of their lands; do they leave their money at his
bar? Nary! They spend sum uv it <span class="pagenum"><a id=
"page234" name="page234"></a>234</span>at the store uv a
disorganizer from Illinoy, who is here interferin with the biznis
uv troo Southern men, but he hed never seed one uv em inside his
door. He hed no pashence with em, and believed suthin shood be done
to rid the community uv sich yooseless inhabitance. Ef they ever
git votes they&rsquo;r agin us. No man who dodges my bar ever votes
straight Dimocrisy.</p>
<p>Ginral Punt moved that this meetin do to wunst proceed to the
settlement, and clean em out. They wuz a reproach to Kentucky. Of
course, ez they were heathens and savages, sich goods ez they hed
wood fall to the righteous, uv whom we wuz which, and he insisted
upon a fair divide. All he wanted wuz a bureau and a set uv chairs
he hed seen.</p>
<p>The motion wuz amendid to inclood Pollock, the Illinoy
store-keeper, and it wuz to wunst acted upon.</p>
<p>Pollock wuz reconstructed first. Filled with zeal for the right,
his door wuz bustid in, and in a jiffy the goods wich he wuz a
contaminatin our people with wuz distributed among the people, each
takin sich ez sooted em. Wun man sejested that ez they wuz made by
Yankees, and brought south by Yankees, that there wuz contaminashen
in the touch uv em, and that they be burned, but he wuz hooted
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page235" name=
"page235"></a>235</span>down, our people seein a distinction. The
contaminashen wuz in payin for em; gittin em gratooitusly took the
cuss off.</p>
<p>Elated, the crowd started for the settlement. I never saw more
zeal manifested. A half hour brought us there, and then a scene
ensood wich filled me with joy onspeekable. The niggers wuz routed
out, and their goods wuz bundled after em. The Bibles and skool
books wuz destroyed first, coz we hed no use for them; their
chairs, tables, and bureaus, clothin and beddin, wuz distributed. A
wooman hed the impudence to beg for suthin she fancied, when the
righteous zeal uv my next door neighbor, Pettus, biled over, and he
struck her. Her husband, forgettin his color, struck Pettus, and
the outrage wuz completed. <em>A nigger hed raised his hand agin a
white man!</em></p>
<p>The insulted Caucashen blood riz, and in less than a minit the
bodies uv six male Ethiopians wuz a danglin in the air, and the
bodies uv six Ethiopian wimin wuz layin prostrate on the earth. The
children wuz spared, for they wuz still young, and not hevin bin
taught to read so far that they could not forgit it, ef kept
carefully from books, they kin be brought up in their proper speer,
ez servance to their brethern. (By the way, the inspired writer
must <span class="pagenum"><a id="page236" name=
"page236"></a>236</span>hev yoosed this word
&ldquo;brethern,&rdquo; in this connection, figeratively. The
nigger, bein a beast, cannot be our brother.) Some may censure us
for too much zeal in this matter, but what else cood we hev dun? We
are high toned, and can&rsquo;t stand everything. These niggers hed
no rite to irritate us by their presence. They knowd our feelins on
the subjick, and by buyin land and remainin in the visinity, they
kindled the flame wich resulted ez it did. Ez they did in Memphis
and Noo Orleans, they brought their fate onto their own heads.</p>
<p>Pollock recovered, and with the Yankee school marm who wuz a
teechin the niggers, left for the North yesterday. It speeks well
for the forbearance uv our people that they wuz permitted to depart
at all.</p>

<p>I wuz sent for to come to Washington, from my comfortable
quarters at the Post Offis, to attend the convenshun uv sich
soldiers and sailors uv the United States ez bleeve in a Union uv
36 States, and who hev sworn allejinse to a flag with 36 stars onto

Rev. <span class="sc">Henry Ward Beecher</span>, wuz to hev bin the
chaplin uv the convenshun, but he failed us, and it wuz decided in
a Cabinet meetin that I shood take his place. I didn&rsquo;t see
the necessity uv hevin a chaplin at every little convenshun uv our
party, and so stated; but Seward remarked, with a groan, that ef
ever there wuz a party, since parties wuz invented, wich needed
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page238" name=
"page238"></a>238</span>prayin for, ours wuz that party.
&ldquo;And, Parson,&rdquo; sed he, glancin at a list uv delegates,
&ldquo;ef yoo hev any agonizin petitions, any prayers uv extra
fervency, offer em up for these fellers. Ef there is any efficacy
in prayer, it&rsquo;s my honest, unbiased opinion that there never

magnificent chance to make it manifest. Try yoorself particularly

&ldquo;sixty days&rdquo; and &ldquo;ninety days,&rdquo; paying no
more attention to the rest uv us than ez ef we wuzn&rsquo;t there
at all.</p>
<p>So, receevin transportashen and suffishent money from the secret
service fund for expenses, I departed for Cleveland, and after a
tejus trip thro&rsquo; an Ablishn country, I arrived there. My
thots were gloomy beyond expression. I hed recently gone through
this same country ez chaplin to the Presidential tour, and every
stashen hed its pecooliar onpleasant remembrances. Here wuz where
the cheers for Grant were vociferous, with nary a snort

strength left to ride up Bank street, in Cleveland, the scen uv the
most awful insult the Eggsecutive ever receeved.</p>
<p>The evenin I arrived, the delegates, sich ez wuz on hand, held a

the crowd finally got together. Genral Wool wuz ez gay and frisky

Custar, uv Michigan, with his hair freshly oiled and curled, and
busslin about ez though he hed cheated hisself into the beleef that

who hed distinguished theirselves in the late war, but who hed
never got their deserts, ceptin by brevet, owin to the fact that

in a pekuniary pint uv view, suthin the worse for wear, tho&rsquo;
why that shood hev bin the case I coodent see (they hevin bin, to
an alarmin extent, quartermasters <span class="pagenum"><a id=
"page240" name="page240"></a>240</span>and commissaries, and in the
recrootin service), til I notist the prevailin color uv their
noses, and heerd one uv em ask his neighbor ef Cleveland wuz blest
with a faro bank! Then I knowd all about it.</p>
<p>There wuz another pekooliarity about it which for a time amoozed
me. Them ez wuz present wuz divided into 2 classes&mdash;those ez
hed bin recently appinted to posishens, and them ez expected to be
shortly. I notist on the countenances uv the first class a look uv
releef, sich ez I hev seen in factories Saturday nite, after the
hands wuz paid off for a hard week&rsquo;s work; and on the other
class the most wolfish, hungry, fierce expression I hev ever
witnessed. Likewise, I notist that the latter set uv patriots
talked more hefty uv the necessity uv sustainin the policy uv our
firm and noble President, and damned the Ablishunists with more
emphasis and fervency than the others.</p>
<p>One enthoosiastic individual, who hed bin quartermaster two
years, and hed bin allowed to resign &ldquo;jest after the battle,
mother,&rdquo; wich, hevin his papers all destroyed, made settlin
with the government a easy matter, wuz so feroshus that I felt
called upon to check him. &ldquo;Gently, my frend,&rdquo; sed I,
&ldquo;gently! I hev bin thro&rsquo; this thing; I hev my
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page241" name=
"page241"></a>241</span>commission. It broke out on me jest ez it
hez on yoo; but yoo won&rsquo;t git yoor Assessorship a minit
sooner for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It ain&rsquo;t a Assessorship I want,&rdquo; sez he.
&ldquo;I hev devoted myself to the task uv bindin up the wounds uv
my beloved country&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you stop anybody very much from inflictin them sed
wounds?&rdquo; murmured I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An ef I accept the Post Orfis in my native
village,&mdash;which I hev bin solissited so strongly to take that
I hev finally yielded,&mdash;I do it only that I may devote my few
remainin energies wholly to the great cause uv restorin the 36
States to their normal posishens under the flag with 36 stars onto
it, in spite uv the Joodis Iskariots wich, ef I am whom, wat is the
Saviour, and&mdash;and where is&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Perseevin that the unfortunate man hed got into the middle uv a
quotashen from the speech uv our noble and patriotic President, and
knowin his intellek wuzn&rsquo;t hefty enough to git it off jist as
it wuz originally delivered, I took him by the throat, and shet off
the flood uv his elokence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be quiet, yoo idiot!&rdquo; remarked I, soothingly, to
him. &ldquo;Yoo&rsquo;ll git your apintment, becoz, for the fust
time in the history uv this or any other Republic, <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page242" name=
"page242"></a>242</span>there&rsquo;s a market for jist sich men ez
yoo; but all this blather won&rsquo;t fetch it a minit
sooner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good Lord!&rdquo; tho&rsquo;t I, ez I turned away,
&ldquo;wat a President A.J. is, to hev to buy up <em>sich</em>
cattle! Wat a postmaster he must be, whose gineral cussedness turns
<em>my</em> stummick!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It wuz deemed necessary to see uv wat we wuz compozed; whereupon
Kernel K&mdash;&mdash;, who is now Collector uv Revenue in Illinoy,
asked ef there wuz ary man in the room who hed bin a prizner doorin
the late fratricidle struggle. A gentleman uv, perhaps, thirty
aroze, and sed he wuz. He hed bin taken three times, and wuz,
altogether, 18 months in doorance vile in three diffrent
prizns.</p>
<p>Custar fell on his neck, and asked him, aggitatidly, ef he wuz
shoor&mdash;quite shoor, after sufferin all that, that he supported
the policy of the President? Are you quite shoor&mdash;quite
shoor?</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am,&rdquo; returned the phenomenon. &ldquo;I stand by
Andrew Johnson and his policy, and I don&rsquo;t want no
office!!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hev yoo got wun?&rdquo; shouted they all in korus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nary!&rdquo; sed he. &ldquo;With me it is a matter uv
principle!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wat prizns wuz yoo incarcerated in?&rdquo; asked I,
lookin at him with wonder.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page243" name=
"page243"></a>243</span>&ldquo;Fust at Camp Morton, then at Camp
Douglas, and finally at Johnson&rsquo;s Island!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Custar dropt him, and the rest remarked that, while they hed a
very helthy opinion uv him, they guessed he&rsquo;d better not
menshen his presence, or consider hisself a delegate. Ez ginerous
foes they loved him ruther better than a brother; yet, as the call
didn&rsquo;t quite inclood him, tho&rsquo; there wuz a delightful
oneness between em, yet, ef &rsquo;twuz all the same, he hed better
not announce hisself. He wuz from Kentucky, I afterwards
ascertained.</p>
<p>The next mornin, suthin over two hundred more arriv; and the
delegashens bein all in, it wuz decided to go on with the show. A
big tent hed bin brought on from Boston to accommodate the expected
crowd, and quite an animated discussion arose ez to wich corner uv
it the Convenshun wuz to ockepy. This settled, the biznis wuz
begun. Genral <span class="sc">Wool</span> wuz made temporary
Chairman, to wich honor he responded in a elokent extemporaneous
speech, which he read from manuscript. General <span class=
"sc">Ewing</span> made another extemporaneous address, which he
read from manuscript, and we adjourned for dinner.</p>

<p>THE CLEVELAND CONVENTION.</p>

<p>The dinner hour was spent in caucussin privately in one uv the
parlors uv the hotel. The Chairman <span class="pagenum"><a id=
"page244" name="page244"></a>244</span>asked who shood make
speeches after dinner, wen every man uv em pulled from his right
side coat pocket a roll uv manuscript, and sed he hed dotted down a
few ijees wich he hed conclooded to present extemporaneously to the
Convenshun. That Babel over, the Chairman sed he presoomed some one
shood be selected to prepare a address; whereupon every delegate
rose, and pulled a roll uv manuscript from his left side coat
pocket, and sed he hed dotted down a few ijees on the situashn,
wich he proposed to present, et settry. This occasioned another
shindy; wen the Chairman remarked &ldquo;Resolushens,&rdquo; wen
every delegate rose, pulled a roll uv manuscript from his right
breast coat pocket, and sed he hed jotted down a few ijees, wich,
&amp;c.</p>
<p>I stood it until some one mentioned me ez Chaplin to the
expedition West, when the pressure becum unendurable. They sposed I
was keeper uv the President&rsquo;s conscience, and I hed not a
minit&rsquo;s peece after that. In vain I ashoored em that, there
bein no consciences about the White House, no one could hold sich a
offis; in vain I ashoored em that I hed no influence with His
Majesty. Two thirds uv em pulled applicashens for places they
wanted from the left breast coat pocket, and insistid on my takin
em, and seem that they was appinted. <span class="pagenum"><a id=
"page245" name="page245"></a>245</span>I told em that I cood do
nuthin for em; but they laft me to skorn. &ldquo;You are jist the
style uv man,&rdquo; said they, &ldquo;who hez inflooence with His
Eggslency, and yoo must do it.&rdquo; Hemmed in, there wuz but one
way uv escape, and that way I took. Seezin a carpet sack, wich, by
the way, belonged to a delegate (I took it to give myself the look
of a traveler), I rushed to the depot, and startid home, entirely
satisfied that ef Cleveland may be taken as a sample, the less His
Majesty depends on soljers, the better.</p>

October 1, 1866.</p>
<p>President Johnson, who hez bin likened to Androo Jaxon, and
wich, since my appintment I conseed him to be, in many partikelers,
his sooperior, requested me and William H. Seward (his secretary
and chaplin) to draw up and publish to the Democracy of the various
States holdin elecshuns this fall an address, or ruther an appeal,
firmly beleevin that hed he extendid his tour to Maine, and isshood
an address to em, that that state wood not hev gone ez it did.
William refoozed to take part in the appeal, sayin that it warnt uv
no use, and so the dooty devolved upon me.</p>
<h4>Democrats and Conservatives uv the North:</h4>
<p>Appresheatin the gravity uv the isshoo, I address yoo. The signs
uv the times is ominus. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page247" name=
"page247"></a>247</span>A Radikle Congress, electid durin the time
when the Southin States, wich comprises reely all the intellek uv
this people, didn&rsquo;t take no part in the elekshen, bein too
bizzy gettin out uv Sherman&rsquo;s way to open polls,&mdash;a
Congress, I repeat, in wich there ain&rsquo;t no Southern man, and
wich consekently kant, by any stretch uv the hooman imaginashen, be
considered Constitooshnel, hez dared to thwart the President uv the
United States, and set up its will agin hisn! I need skarcely
recount its high-handed acts uv usurpashen. It passed a bill givin
rites to niggers, wich, accordin to Scripter (see Onesimus, Ham,
and Hagar, the only three texts in Scripter uv any partikeler
account) and the yoosages uv the Democrisy, ain&rsquo;t got no
rites; and the President, exercisin the high prerogatives put into
his hands by the Constitooshen, vetoed it. Here the matter should
hev endid. He hed expressed, in a manner strikly Constitooshenel,
his objecshens to the measure; and a proper regard for his feelins,
and just deference for his opinions, ought to hev indicated the
right course. Here wuz peace offered this Congres. Here wuz the
tender uv a olive branch. The President didn&rsquo;t want a quarrel
with Congres; he didn&rsquo;t desire a continyooance uv the
agitation wich hed shook the country like a Illinois ager; but he
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page248" name=
"page248"></a>248</span>desired Peece. Congres cood hev hed it hed
they only withdrawed their crood noshens uv what wus rite and what
wuz wrong; ratified, ez they shood hev done, sich laws ez the
President saw fit to make: in short, hed they follered the correct
rool when we hev a Demokratic President, and put the Government in
his hands, with an abidin trust in his rectitood and wisdom, we
mite hev avoided this struggle, and thus wood hev bin peaceful. But
this reckless Congris, bent upon consentrating power in its hands
instid uv dividin it between him and Seward, passed the bill over
his head, regardlis uv his feelins! The responsibility for the
dissension rests, therefore, with Congres.</p>
<p>But these questions are altogether too hefty for the Demokratic
intellek, and I fling em out for the considerashen uv the few Post
Masters we get from the Union ranks. To the Dimocrisy I Address
myself more partickerlerly.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Do you want to Marry a Nigger?</span> This
ishoo is agin before yoo. Are you in favor uv elevatin the Afrikin
to a posishen where he kin be yoor ekal, or perhaps yoor sooperior?
That ishoo is agin before yoo for yoor decision, only the danger to
yoo is increased. The matter has become threatening; for, disgise
it ez we may, thousands uv em <span class="pagenum"><a id="page249"
name="page249"></a>249</span>kin read, and they are akkumulatin
property, and wearin good clothes to a extent trooly alarmin to the
Dimokratic mind. We hev alluz consoled ourselves with the soothin
reflection that there wuz a race lower down in the scale uv
humanity than us uns. Shall we continue to enjoy that comfort?
That&rsquo;s the question for every Dimokrat to consider when he
votes this fall. Remove the weight uv legal disability, and ten to
one ef they don&rsquo;t outstrip us even, and then where are we
goin to look for a race to look down upon? It&rsquo;s a close thing
atween us now; and ez we uv this generation can&rsquo;t elevate
ourselves, why, for our own peece uv mind, we must,&mdash;I repeet
it,&mdash;<span class="sc">must</span> pull them down.</p>
<p>Agin then I repeet, <span class="sc">Do you want to Marry a
Nigger</span>? Yoor daughters wunst carried banners onto wich wuz
inskribed that trooly Dimokratic motto, &ldquo;White husbands or
none!&rdquo; and in consequence they&rsquo;ve bin mostly livin in
the enjoyment uv none. Are they to go back on that holy
determinashen to preserve the Anglo Sackson race on this continent
in its purity? Do yoo want the nigger&mdash;the big buck
nigger&mdash;the flat-footed nigger&mdash;the woolly-headed
nigger&mdash;the long-heeled nigger&mdash;the bow-legged
nigger&mdash;the <span class="sc">Nigger</span>&mdash;to step up
aside uv yoo, and exercise the prerogatives uv freemeen
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page250" name=
"page250"></a>250</span>in this country? Do you want the nigger
aforesed to be mayors uv your towns, with all the hatred they hev
towards us? Wat chance, O Dimokratic dweller in cities! think yoo
yoo&rsquo;d hev if hauled up afore a nigger mayor on a charge uv
disorderly conduct? Wat chance wood yoor children hev in a skool uv
wich all the teechers wuz niggers? Wat chance wood yoo hev wen
arrestid for small misdemeanors, afore nigger judges?</p>
<p>How, let me ask, in the name of High Heaven, wood yoo like to be
tried for hoss stealin afore a nigger jury?</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; say some uv yoo, who, set ravin by drums, and
flags, and sich, went off violently into the war, and wuz, perhaps,
saved from starvin by niggers, &ldquo;these niggers wuz our friends
in the late war&mdash;they fought agin the South!&rdquo;</p>
<p>O, wat a deloosion! O, wat blindnis! Troo, they did; and that
shows the danger that&rsquo;s afore us; that lifts the fog from the
precipise onto wich we are standin, and shows us our danger. Wat
does this fact prove? It proves the onreasonableness uv the
Nigger&mdash;his discontentednis with the posishen to wich nacher
assigned him, and his cussid disposition to upset the normal
condition. The Bible makes him a servant unto his brethren (see
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page251" name=
"page251"></a>251</span>Ham, Hagar, and Onesimus, three blessed
texts). Science proves him to be, not a man, but a beast; and so,
take him ez we may, either ez our brother or ez a beast,&mdash;and
Dimocrisy, with that liberality wich hez always distinguished it,
gives every man his choice wich theory to take,&mdash;his condition
is servitood. But he, with a cussidness, a perversity wich I never
cood understand, flies into the face uv the Divine decree, flies
into the face uv science, and asserts his independence! He turned
agin them ez hed fostered him; turned agin, in many instances, his
own parents (in these instances, for convenience, the parents
adopted the brethren theory), and for an abstract idea fought agin
em. That restlessness under bonds alarmed the Dimocratic mind. We
who owned em under the Skripter (see Onesimus, Hagar, and Ham), and
under the eternal laws uv scientific trooth wuz content with the
arrangement, and why shood they not hev bin? Things wuz normal.
They worked, and we eat; and ef they hed bin content with this
ekitable division uv the labor uv life, all wood hev bin smooth
to-day.</p>
<p>Their takin part agin us at the South, and in favor uv the
Federals, is, instead uv a coz uv feelin good toward em, a source
uv oneasiness; instid uv bein a reason for elevatin uv em,
it&rsquo;s my principal <span class="pagenum"><a id="page252" name=
"page252"></a>252</span>reason for depressin uv em. Sich onsettled
minds shood be quieted; this itchin to raise theirselves shood be
crushed out uv em, that Science and Holy Writ (see Onesimus, Hagar,
and Ham) may be vindicated.</p>
<p>Shel we desert Androo Johnson, after all the trouble he hez bin
to in gettin back to us? Shel we elect a Congres this fall so
soaked in Ablishin&mdash;so filled with objeckshuns to our Southern
brethren, ez to refooze to receive em back into the seats which
they vacated? Consider! The Southern Dimokracy hevn&rsquo;t, and
don&rsquo;t, lay up nothin agin yoo. They are willin to forgive and
forget. They failed, but they are willin to forgiv the cause uv the
failyoor. They hevn&rsquo;t got the government they wanted, but
they find no fault with that, but are willin to take charge of the
wun they hev bin compelled to live under. Kin they offer fairer?
The fate uv war wuz agin em. Buryin all hard feelins, they extend
to us Chrischen charity, and say, Here we are&mdash;take
us&mdash;give us our old places. They hev bin chastened. Their
household gods hev bin destroyed, and their temples torn down. Wun
neighbor uv mine lost two sons in the Confedrit army; another son,
which he hed refoosed $1500 for in 1860, he wuz compelled to shoot,
coz he wuz bound to <span class="pagenum"><a id="page253" name=
"page253"></a>253</span>run away into the Federal army; and two
octoroons, which he hed a dozen times refoosed $2500 for, each, in
Noo Orleans, he saw layin dead on the steps uv a skool house in
Memphis. Hez he suffered nothin? And yet he is willin to take a
seat in Congress&mdash;forgettin all he hez suffered, and forgivin
the cause thereof. What wickedness it is wich would further bruise
sich a broken reed!</p>
<p>Therefore, ez yoo love yourselves and hate the nigger, I implore
yoo to act. Take yoor choice uv the platforms uv the different
States&mdash;vote ez a Johnson Unionist, or ez a Democratic
Johnsonian&mdash;but vote.</p>
<p>Kentucky holds out her hands appealingly! Kentucky implores yoo
to bild up a bulwark North uv the Ohio River to save what little is
left uv pure Dimocracy there! Kentucky will back yoo in yoor
endeavors. Will you heed her cry? Shel she appeel in vain? Forbid
it, Hevin!</p>

(wich is in the Stait uv Kentucky),<br />
October 14, 1866.</p>
<p>There is mournin in Kentucky. The results of the elections in
Ohio, Injeany, Pennsylvany, and Iowa reached me yesterday through a
Looisville paper, wich wuz dropped off the cars at Secessionville,
wich is the nearest station to us, and wich, I hapnin to be there,
I picked up.</p>
<p>Ohio&mdash;40,000 Ablishin!</p>
<p>Injeany&mdash;20,000 Ablishin!</p>
<p>Pennsylvany&mdash;20,000 Ablishin!</p>
<p>Iowa&mdash;30,000 Ablishin!</p>
<p><span class="sc">Ablishin</span>! Wat a dreery waste uv
Ablishin! Not a single oasis uv Dimocrisy anywhere,&mdash;nary
Aryrat on wich our ark kin rest in safety,&mdash;but all around us
the mad waves uv Ablishnism rearin their crestid heads muchly.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page255" name=
"page255"></a>255</span>I felt it my dooty to make this fact known
to my neighbors; for, sposin that His Serene Highness&rsquo; trip
wood secure us enuff deestricts to make the next Congress safe, and
consekently make us certin uv admission, they hed been makin
arrangements for restorin things to their normal condishun, ez they
were before the war.</p>
<p>In fact, two weeks before, in view of the expected success uv
the Democracy, a meetin hed bin held on the subject. Some wuz for
at once seezin the niggers wherever they cood be found, and puttin
em at work; but the conservatives overruled this. They held that
slavery hed bin abolished, and that it ought not be restored; in
fact, that, to act in good faith, it cood not be
re&euml;stablished. Deekin Pogram announced a plan. The town
authorities shood pass a ordinance for the proper government uv the
niggers. Their good and ourn demanded it. For instance, they shood
not be permitted to be out after 7 o&rsquo;clock, P.M., in the
evenin; they shoodent leave the plantashen onto wich they wuz
employed; they shood work every day till 7; and to do away with the
pernicious work uv the Freedmen&rsquo;s Bureau, no man and wife
wich hed bin married by a chaplin uv the Bureau, or by any one
else, shood be employed on the same plantashen, and also no father
or mother <span class="pagenum"><a id="page256" name=
"page256"></a>256</span>and child. Sich ez violated these
ordinances shood be arrested by anybody, and fined; and in default
uv payment uv the fine and costs, shood be sold to the person who
wood take his or her labor for the shortest number uv years, and
pay the fine and costs aforesed. &ldquo;Ez a conservative,&rdquo;
sed the Deekin, &ldquo;I sejest this plan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do yoo want to know my definition uv the word
&lsquo;conservative?&rsquo;&rdquo; sed Joe Bigler, a returned
Confederate soljer, who, I bleeve, hez seen enough uv war.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a man who goes a roundabout way to do a devlish
mean thing. Deekin, why can&rsquo;t yoo go to the devil by a
straight road, ez I do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The interupshen uv the demoralized wretch wuzn&rsquo;t notist;
and ez the trustees uv the township wuz all present, the ordinance
wuz passed, and that night two thirds uv the niggers within five
miles uv the Corners wuz arrested and sold, and within two weeks
every one hed bin capcherd.</p>
<p>I hied me to the Corners, and the first man I saw wuz Bascom,
the grocery keeper, engaged in the congenial biznis uv tappin a
barrel uv contentment, wich he hed just receeved. I wuz a goin to
tell him the dread intelligence, when he caught site uv me.
&ldquo;Taste that, Parson,&rdquo; sed he, holdin out a tin dipper
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page257" name=
"page257"></a>257</span>full. I drank it off, and one look at him
onmand me. &ldquo;Kin I o&rsquo;ercloud that smilin cheek?&rdquo;
thot I, ez, in a fit uv absent-mindednis,&mdash;wich I hev every
now and then,&mdash;I held out the empty dipper to be filled agin,
wich it wuz. &ldquo;No! for a time he shel be spared;&rdquo; and I
borrered his mule, and rode away pensively.</p>
<p>I wuz goin fust to Deekin Pogram&rsquo;s, for he wuz the most
interested uv eny in the settlement. After the meetin mentioned
above, the Deekin hed caused the arrest uv sich niggers ez he cood
ketch, and had had em fined in sums uv $275 and uppards, wich bein
unable, ez a rool, to pay the fine, he hed kindly bid em in.</p>
<p>He hed picked up, here and there, all uv his old servants,
ceptin those wich hed bin killed in the army, and the few misguided
ones wich hed made their way North, and that mornin the plantashen
wuz to be reconstructed upon the old patriarkle system. Mrs. Deekin
Pogram wuz marshellin four uv the likeliest wenches I ever saw in
the kitchen; his son Tom wuz chuckin a yaller girl under the chin,
wich hed bin born on the place about eighteen years before, and
wich, owin to a unfortunate resemblance to the Deekin, bed caused a
onpleasantnis between him and his wife, wich endid in the loss uv
the most <span class="pagenum"><a id="page258" name=
"page258"></a>258</span>uv his hair, and the sellin uv the
girl&rsquo;s mother to Noo Orleans. The two girls hed each their
waitin-maids, and wuz a puttin them through their paces. There hed
bin some trouble in gittin em reconstructed, it bein deemed nessary
to take the conseet out uv em, wich they wuz all a doin. Ez I rode
up, the old lady bed jest knocked one uv em down with a
fire-shovel, and wuz dancin a Highland fling onto her prostrate
body. Almira, the oldest gal, hed her fingers in the wool uv her
gal; and tother one wuz a thumpin hern to redose her to her proper
level; and the Deekin hisself wuz a deelin with one ongrateful
wretch, who objected to bein put to work on them terms, not
realizin that the Bureau was gone. Ez the Deekin hed a revolver he
yielded the pint, and submitted to be flogged, wich the Deekin wuz
doin ez neatly ez I ever saw, considerin he hed bin out uv practis
four years. He had him tied up to a tree, and wuz a wollopin uv him
gorjus. While he wuz a convinsin uv him with his whip that there
wuz trooth in the Skripter, and that Ham wuz reely a servant unto
his bretherin, I exclaimed, &ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; and immejitly
whispered the appallin news in his left ear (tother one hed bin
chawed off in a misunderstandin at Bascom&rsquo;s the previous
Sunday nite, after servis). Never shel I forgit the look uv woe
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page259" name=
"page259"></a>259</span>on that eminent Christian&rsquo;s face. The
whip fell from his nerveless hand; and with teers streemin down his
cheeks, washin up little streaks uv dirt in the most heart-rendin
manner, he gasped in a husky voice to the wife uv his buzzum,
&ldquo;Cut him down, Mirandy! The North&rsquo;s gone Ablishin, and
the d&mdash;&mdash;d niggers will be free anyhow!&rdquo; and the
old patriarch swooned away at my feet.</p>
<p>And sich an expression of anguish ez distorted the face uv the
Deekin&rsquo;s wife I hope never to see agin. Droppin the shovel,
she stood ez one petrified, with her foot elevated in mid air, ez
in the act uv stompin, and uttering a shreek wich methinks I hear
ringing in my ears yet, she fell precisely ez she stood, with her
leg crooked ez ef &rsquo;twuz froze there. Tom released the gal he
wuz subdooin, and mountin his horse rode off to the Corners without
saying a word; and unable to witness the distress uv that stricken
family, I made haste to mount my mule and go to; while the niggers,
feelin that they were wunst more their own men and women, scattered
in every direction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sich is the froots uv Radikelism,&rdquo; murmured I.
&ldquo;Sich is the bitter cup fanaticism hez put to our
lips;&rdquo; and castin one lingring look at the prostrate forms uv
the Deekin, his wife (with her foot insensibly <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page260" name="page260"></a>260</span>raised), and
their two gushin daughters, I spurred the mule, and departed.</p>
<p>Wood that every Ablishnist in the North hed seen that site, and
wuz possessed uv a sole to appreshate it! Then would they vote
differently.</p>

Opinion on the Cause of the Defeat of the President.</p>
<p class="address"><span class="sc">Confedrit &times;

(wich is in the Stait uv Kentucky),<br />
October 14, 1866.</p>
<p>I wuz called in haste to Washington to be present at a Cabinet
meetin called to consider the causes uv the onparalleled loosenin
uv the Nashnel Union Johnson Dimekratic party in the various States
wich held elections on the 9th uv October last. There wuz Seward,
Wells, McCulloch, and Randall present; but we missed Raymond and
Beecher, they hevin, I understand, played off onto us.</p>
<p>The President wuz gloomy. He hedn&rsquo;t anticipated the
defeat. He spected that, hevin showd hisself through all the
Northern States, ther ought to hev ben enthoosiasm enough evolved
to hev carried em without trouble. The fault, he remarked, coodent
be with his policy. Ther wuz suthin so grand, so <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page262" name="page262"></a>262</span>sublimely
simple in it, that it wuz incomprehensible to him why the people
hedn&rsquo;t at once adopted it. &ldquo;Why, look at it,&rdquo; sed
he. &ldquo;I offer the people uv the North peace, on the simple
condishn uv sayin nothin more about the war, or the mutual trouble
which they found theirselves into, and rushin into the arms uv
their Southern brethren, and takin uv em back jist ez they went
out. How, O! how cood they be so blind ez to refoose these olive
branches?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Randall replied that he coodent understand it; but he hed
summoned a Postmaster to attend, wich he hed appinted on his solemn
asshoorance that he cood carry enough Republicans over to our new
party to defeat the Union member in that District, wich he notist
by the papers wuz elected by a larger majority than he hed ever
reseeved, and he wuz in waitin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bring in the wretch!&rdquo; shouted the President; and
the guard brung him in. A mizable lookin objick he wuz. Ez soon ez
he saw the stern eye uv the President fixed on him, he sunk to his
knees, and lifted up his hands implorinly, without sayin a
word.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Speak!&rdquo; sed the President. &ldquo;Why the result in
yoor Deestrict?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My liege,&rdquo; replied the wretched man, &ldquo;I know
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page263" name=
"page263"></a>263</span>not. Faithfully I labored; but the people
wood come into the house holdin their noses, and set a holdin uv em
so long ez I wuz speekin, wich wuzn&rsquo;t conducive to displays
of oratory. The papers wood publish my own utterances six months
before, wich confused me somewhat; and the ablishnists would read
at me yoor speeches, wich I coodent akkount for. I seekoored for
yoo suthin like a dozen votes; but they wuz them ez stipulated for
places under me, and I hed hard work to git em from the Union
party, and they wuz sich ez did us more harm than good. And
besides&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Enuff!&rdquo; sed Johnson, &ldquo;Remove him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the poor fellow wuz bundled out.</p>
<p>Secretary Welles knowd wat wuz the matter. It come uv takin
Grant and Farrygut along on the excursion. It distracted the
attention uv the people. Hed there bin nobody but the President and
the Cabinet along, there woodent hev bin nobody to hurrah for, and
the sublime trooths, wieh the President kin only jerk, wood hev
impressed the people more than they did.</p>
<p>Seward wuz confident that the election wood hev bin all right
cood it hev bin postponed ninety days; while McCullock attribooted
it to the limited knowledge the masses hed uv Injeany bankin.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page264" name=
"page264"></a>264</span>I wuz rekested to give my views, wich I
did.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My lords,&rdquo; sed I, &ldquo;none uv you hev got the
ijee. We wuz beet because we left the landmarks&mdash;that&rsquo;s
wat ailed us, wuz the anshent landmarks. Wat hed we to go into this
canvass with? Democrisy? Not any; for that wuz squelched at
Philadelphia. Wat then? Why, the offises. Offises, in the abstract,
is good. That little one which I hold in Kentucky I coodent be
indoost to part with on no account; but yoo can&rsquo;t run a party
on em, because there ain&rsquo;t enough uv em.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My liege, on my return from the Philadelphia Convention I
tarried a while in Berks county, which is in Pennsylvania, and is
distinguished for the unanimity with which they vote Democracy. My
liege, they learned down there mor&rsquo;n six weeks ago that the
war wuz over, and therefore yoo coodent stir em up on drafts. Taxes
they had got used to, and that didn&rsquo;t move em; and so the
speaker wuz emptyin school-houses by talkin uv the results uv a
glorious war, wich they all opposed, and praisin our mutual friend
Seward, wich they had alluz hated as a Ablishnist, and hedn&rsquo;t
heerd yet that he had jined the Demokracy. Wuz it any wonder that
we went under? Ther ain&rsquo;t but one thing left to us, and that
we strangely neglected. My liege, why wuz the <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page265" name="page265"></a>265</span><span class=
"sc">Nigger</span> not made the central figger this year, ez
before? They is the capital uv the Democrisy, its refuge, its tower
of strength. I spoke in Berks county myself, following one of them
new-fangled Democrats, who hed set em all asleep talkin stuff to em
that they didn&rsquo;t understand. Mountin the rostrum, I
ejaculated,&mdash;</p>
<p>&rdquo;&rsquo;<span class="sc">Men and Brethren, do yoo want to
marry a Nigger</span>?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;No! no!&rsquo; they answered, straightenin up
towunst.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Do you want niggers for sons-in-law?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;No! no!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Do you want laws to prevent you from marryin
niggers?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Yes! yes!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Do you want to be marched up to the polls by those
who tell you how to vote, beside a nigger?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;No! no!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Then vote the Demekratic ticket.&rsquo; And they
all replied,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;We will! we will!&rsquo; and they did. You see,
your Exslency, the Demekratic mind isn&rsquo;t hefty enough to
comprehend them fine arguments ez to constitootinality, et setry;
and when a speaker deals in em, they suspect his Dimocrisy, and
fight shy uv <span class="pagenum"><a id="page266" name=
"page266"></a>266</span>him. But nigger they kin all understand.
It&rsquo;s soothin to the Dimekratic mind to be continyooally told
that there is somebody lower down in the skale. They desire a
inferior race, and therefore hev bin pullin the nigger down toward
em for years. Did yoo not notis whenever we went it on the nigger
we succeeded in awakenin an enthoosiasm, wich, when we neglected
him, or selected other issues, we failed to get?</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s based upon philosophical trooths. The poorer
and meaner a man is, the more anxious he is to hev it understood
that there&rsquo;s somebody still poorer and meaner than him.
Hence, you notis, that them individooals who see a 5 cent peese so
seldom ez to not know its nacher, and who keep the flag uv distress
wavin from the seat uv their pants,&mdash;who, ef niggers wuz
sellin at a cent a peese, coodent raise enough to buy the toe nail
uv one,&mdash;is the most ardent friends of Slavery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That pitiful man wich jest left the presence wuz not to
blame for the result in his Deestrick. He tried to earn his bread;
but wat cood he do? The Ablishnists knowd he wuz bought with a
price, and laffed at him. The Democrisy, sich ez voted, we&rsquo;d
hev got anyhow. Them ez didn&rsquo;t vote, nor do <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page267" name="page267"></a>267</span>nothin, wuz
the upper class, wich expected the offises themselves, and wuz
disgusted accordinly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My liege, I hev spoke. Yoo can&rsquo;t do nothin with a
new party; for yoo kin only git the Dimocrisy to jine it, and they
won&rsquo;t do it onless the offises is throwd in. Yoo can&rsquo;t
run the Dimocrisy on only one issue, and that&rsquo;s the nigger;
for it&rsquo;s all they kin understand. So long ez the nigger
exists, Dimocrisy endoors; when the race becomes extinct, the party
dies. The two is indissolubly bound together; one wuz created for
tother, and tother for one. When Noah cust Ham he laid the
foundashens uv Dimocrisy. Ham wuz turned into a nigger because Noah
got intoxicated. His misfortune originated with wine; and whisky,
wich is the modern substitoot therefor, bein the motive power uv
Dimocrisy, hez bin persekutin him ever sence. I attriboot the
decline uv the Dimocrisy to the bleachin out uv the Afrikin, and
that&rsquo;s why I oppose amalgamashen. Yoo can&rsquo;t hate a
mulatter only half ez much ez yoo kin a full-blood; and it will be
observed that the intensity uv Demokricy has decreased precisely in
proportion to the scarcity uv pure blacks. Thus Demokrisy is
committin suicide; it hez bin the means uv its own destruction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know ez there&rsquo;s eny yoose uv talkin.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page268" name=
"page268"></a>268</span>The Congressmen elected this fall continyoo
in offis, my liege, jist precisely ez long ez yoo do, to a day, and
by that time they&rsquo;ll hev it all fixed. Noo York may change in
our favor, but I think not. The break commenst in Maine, and it
increased as it progressed. We&rsquo;re gone in. The Ablishnists
laughs in glee, and the nigger shows all his ivories. We shel hold
our places two years, and then farewell to our greatness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I pity yoo, my lord; but I can&rsquo;t help yoo. Ez for
myself, I kin save enuff out uv my Post Offis to start a small
grocery at the expiration uv my term, and then farewell politics.
In that pleasant callin I&rsquo;ll flote down the stream uv Time,
until Death closes the polls, and ends the struggle. I hev
sed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Conference ended with this: for they wuz all too much
affected to say anything. Seward murmered suthin about it would be
all right in sixty days; that there wuz no denyin that the people
wuz happy; but no one paid any attention to him. I went home,
leavin em all in tears.</p>

October 24, 1866.</p>
<p>Dreams is only vouchsafed to persons uv a imaginative and
speritooal nacher, uv whom I am which. Ther aint anything gross or
sensual about me that I know uv. Troo I eat pork, but that is to
offset the effex uv whisky, wich, ef twasn&rsquo;t counteracted,
wood make me entirely too etherial for this grovelin world. I eat
pork, to restrain my exuberant imaginashun, and enable me to come
down to the dry detail uv offish&rsquo;l life&mdash;to fit me for
the proper discharge uv my dooties ez a Postmaster. Whiskey lifts
me above the posishun&mdash;pork brings me back agin. It&rsquo;s
fat and greasy, like the pay and perquisites uv the
Postmaster&mdash;it comes from the most nasty, senseless, and
unclean <span class="pagenum"><a id="page270" name=
"page270"></a>270</span>uv animals, like our commishuns&mdash;in
short, I recommend all uv Johnson&rsquo;s Postmasters to eat pork.
It&rsquo;s ther nateral diet.</p>
<p>Last nite I partook uv a pound or so too much, and ez a
consekence, didn&rsquo;t sleep well. While I wuz eatin (moistnin my
lips with Looisville conslation the while), I wuz a musin onto
Seward&rsquo;s question, whether they wood hev Johnson President or
King, and while musin I fell in2 the arms uv Morfus. My mind bust
loose from the body and sored. Ez I sunk to slumber, the narrow
room, wich is at wunst my offis and dormitory, widened and
enlarged, the humble chairs become suddenly upholstered in gorgus
style, the taller dip become multiplied into thousands uv gorgus
chandileers, the portraits uv His Highness the President, and the
other Democrats on the wall, became alive. I comprehended the
situation to wunst. <span class="sc">Androo Johnson</span> had cut
the Gorjan knot with someboddy&rsquo;s sword, and hed carried out
his Policy to its nateral concloosion. He was King, and wuz reignin
under the title uv <span class="sc">Androo the I.</span>, and I wuz
(in my dreem uv course) in his kingly halls.</p>
<p>It wuz, methawt, a reception nite. His High Mightiness wuz a
sittin onto a elevated throne, covered with red velvet, and studded
with diamonds, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page271" name=
"page271"></a>271</span>and pearls, and onyxs, and other precious
stones&mdash;onto his head wuz a crown, and he wuz enveloped into a
robe uv black velvet, his nose and the balance uv his face gleaming
out like a flash uv litenin from a thunder cloud. Lyin prostrate at
the foot uv the throne, doin the offis uv a footstool, wuz Charles
Sumner, wunst Senator, wich wuz typikle uv the complete triumph we
hed won over our enemies; while doin other menial offices about the
halls, wuz Wade, Wilson, Fessenden, Sherman, and others who hed
opposed the change from a Republic to a Kingdom. They wuz clothed
in a approprit costoom, knee breeches and sich, and presented a
pekoolyerly imposin appearance.</p>
<p>Carriages containing the nobility began to arrive, and ez they
entered, the Grand High Lord Chamberlin uv the Palis, the Markis
von Randall, announct em. &ldquo;Dook de Davis!&rdquo; was
ejackelatid, and Jeffson entered. &ldquo;Earl von Toombs,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Sir Joseph E. Johnston,&rdquo; &ldquo;Markis de
Bouregard,&rdquo; &ldquo;Count de Pollard,&rdquo; and so forth.</p>
<p>Noticin that the titles I hed heerd wuz mostly tacked to
Southern men, I asked Giddy Welles, who wuz standin by, why it wuz
thus, and he sed that Northners wuzn&rsquo;t reely fit for it. We
wuz, he said, a low, grovlin race, and coodent adapt ourselves to
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page272" name=
"page272"></a>272</span>the habits uv nobility. The South wuz
shivelrus, and cood do it. They wuz given to tournaments and
sich&mdash;they hed got accustomed to cirkus clothes, and cood wear
a sword without its gettin awkwardly between the legs. Northern
men, sich ez were faithful, wuz allowed to barsk in the smiles uv
royalty, but it wuz in sich positions ez sooted their capacity. He,
for instance, hed charge uv the royal poultry yard, a position
which he bleved he filled to the entire satisfaction uv his beloved
and royal master. He hed now four hens a settin, each on four eggs,
and he hoped in the course uv two years, ef there wuz no adverse
circumstances, to hev fresh eggs for the royal table. It wuz a
position uv great responsibility, and one wich weighed upon him.
Seward wuz privy counsler, Doolittle wuz steward uv the household,
and Thurlow Weed wuz Keeper uv the King&rsquo;s revenue, and wuz a
doin very well indeed.</p>
<p>By this time the company assembled. His Highness wuz in a merry
mood, and unbendid hisself. Ther wuz a knot uv the nobility
gathered in a corner, and after a earnest interview uv a minnit,
Count Von Cowan advanced to the foot uv the throne, and on bendid
knee demanded a boon.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page273" name=
"page273"></a>273</span>&ldquo;What, my faithful servitor, dost
thou most desire?&rdquo; sed His Highness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We wood, Your Majesty, hev the prisoners uv state brot
into the presence, that we may make merry over
&rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It shel be done,&rdquo; sed His Majesty, and forthwith
Baron von Steedman, who hed command uv the King&rsquo;s Household
Body Guard, wuz sent for them. In a moment they wuz brot in. They
wuz a mizable lookin set. Forney and Wendell Phillips wuz chained
together, Fred Douglass and Anna Dickinson, Dick Yates and Gov.
Morton, Ben Butler and Carl Shurz, Kelly and Covode, while Chase
wuz tied to Horis Greely, onto whose back wuz a placard, inscribed,
&ldquo;The last uv the Tribunes;&rdquo; at wich Raymond, who left
the Radikels and declared for the empire at precisely the rite
time, and wuz now editor of the <em>Court Journal</em>, laffed
immodritly. Some one exclaimed, &ldquo;Bring in Thad
Stevens!&rdquo; at wich His Majesty turned pale, and his knees
smote together. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t, don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; sez he;
&ldquo;he&rsquo;s strength enuff left to wag his tongue. Keep him
away! keep him away!&rdquo; and he showed ez much fear ez men do in
delirum tremens when they see snakes.</p>
<p>Methawt I made inquiries, and found that things wuz workin
satisfactory. Gen. Grant wuz in exile, <span class="pagenum"><a id=
"page274" name="page274"></a>274</span>and Gen. Sheridan hed bin
decapitatid for refoosin to acquiesce in the new arrangement. The
country hed bin divided into dookdoms and earldoms, and sich, over
wich the nobility rooled with undispooted authority. The principal
men uv the North hed been capcherd and subdooed, and wuz a fillin
menial positions in the palaces uv the nobility. No Lord or Dook or
Earl considered himself well served onless he hed a half dozen
Northern Congressmen in his house, while the higher grade uv
nobility wuzn&rsquo;t content with anythin less than Guvners. The
indebtednis uv the South to the North hed bin adjustid. A decree
hed bin ishood to the effect that Northern merchants who shood
press a claim agin a Southerner shood be beheaded and his goods
confistikated. The question uv slavery hed bin settled forever, for
the Dimekratic ijee uv one class to serve and one class to be
served wuz fully establisht. There wuz now three classes uv
society, the hereditary nobility, the untitled officials, and the
people; the latter, black and white, wuz all serfs, and all
attached to the soil. Biznis wuz all done by foreigners, the policy
uv the government bein to make the native born people purely
agricultural peasantry. The nobility, desirin to make it easy for
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page275" name=
"page275"></a>275</span>em, giv em one sixth uv the produx uv the
soil, reservin the balance for their own uses.</p>
<p>My dreem didn&rsquo;t continyoo long enuff for me to ascertain
whether I wuz a nobleman or not, but I am uv the opinion that I
wuz, for a servant, handin me a pin to stick into Gen. Butler to
make him roar for the amoozement of the company, addressed me ez
&ldquo;Yoor Grace,&rdquo; from wich I inferred that I wuz one uv of
the Lords spiritooal. Unfortunitly at this pint I awoke, and a sad
awakenin it wuz. The gorjus halls hed vanished, the chandeleers hed
vanished, the robes uv stait and jewels and sich wuz gone, and I
wuz in my offis, not &ldquo;Yoor Grace,&rdquo; but merely a
Postmaster in a Kentucky village! Well, that is suthin. Wat better
is a nobleman? He don&rsquo;t work, neither do I. He drinks wine,
it is troo; but I hev wat soots me better&mdash;whiskey fresh from
the still. Yet my dreem may be realized, and ef it is, I will
endevoor to fill the position with credit. Who knows?</p>

<p>The fust wuz from Rev. Henry Ward Beecher. Mr. Beecher remarked

omitted remarkin anythin about Peerce and Bookanan, out uv regard
for the feelins uv the present incumbent, wich, ef he hed read
History correct, wuz a ardent supporter uv the Administrashens uv

desired to say wuz, that he hed a higher regard for the good
opinion uv mankind in general than he hed for the good opinion uv
the accidental incumbent uv any offis; and ez he hed, in a hour uv

reputashen doorin the war ez a cavalry commander. It wuz to the
same effect. He hed, when he spozd that the policy uv the
President, wich he esteemed ez he must any man who held the exalted
position wunst okkepied by the good Washinton, the great Jefferson,
and the sainted Linkin&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The ongrateful dog doesn&rsquo;t respect <span class=
"sc">me</span>!&rdquo; sed Androo; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s the offis I
fill;&rdquo; and he bust into a fresh flood.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page279" name=
"page279"></a>279</span>&mdash;When he spozed the President&rsquo;s
policy wuz sich ez a soljer and patriot cood endorse, he endorsed
it. But he diskivered that it led him, back foremost, into company
wich, doorin the late war, he hed alluz visited face foremost and
on hossback; and therefore, to <span class="sc">save his
reputashun</span>, he must beg that the President wood give it out
that he (Gen. Custar) wuz not, nor never hed bin, a supporter uv
his policy, and oblige</p>
<p class="signature">Yoors trooly, ez before.</p>
<p>I wuz too hart-broken at this to make any reply, and Cowan and
Doolittle wuz in the same fix. The Kernelcy wich wuz given to
Custar to keep him in posishen hed bin promised to a Demokratic
captin, who wuz led by a company in the first Bull Run fight, and
who threw up in disgust the next day, not likin the manner in wich
the war wuz bein conducted; but now the Kernelcy wuz gone, and
Custar too; and wat wuz worse, there wuz no sich thing to be thot
uv ez dismissin him. The entire company yoonited in minglin their
teers.</p>
<p>The next letter wuz read by Seward, ez it wuz addressed to him.
It wuz from Raymond. He opened with the remark that for the
Presidential office he hed the highest respeck. Aside from the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page280" name=
"page280"></a>280</span>considerashen that it hed bin wunst
okkepied by the good Washinton, the great Adams, and the sainted
Linkin, the President mite be considered the Father of his country,
hevin so large a number of helpless children to provide for; and
besides, he hed a instinctive respeck for the dispenser of
anything. It wuz difficult for him, bein a open and simple-minded
man, not to adhere to the President; but&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good Heavens!&rdquo; shreeked Johnson, &ldquo;that little
fox ain&rsquo;t a goin to speak uv <span class="sc">his</span>
reputashen!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dooty requires the reedin uv the entire dockeyment,
painful to my feelins ez it may be,&rdquo; sed Seward. &ldquo;He
concloods thusly:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I am forced to ask yoo, ez one enjoyin
confidenshel relations with Him who occupies the Presidenshel
chair, to hev it given out that I stand in opposition to him. A doo
<span class="sc">regard for my reputashen</span> impels me to this
course. I remain</p>
<p class="signature">&ldquo;&lsquo;Yoors Trooly.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>There wuz 2 or three more. Gen. Carey uv Ohio, requested the
President to remove him from his Collectorship, ez the holdin uv it
wuz <span class="sc">injoorin his reputashen</span>. A editor out
West, who wuz sedooced into takin a Post Offis, begged to hev it
taken off his hands, that he might save his circulashen
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page281" name=
"page281"></a>281</span>before it wuz everlastinly too late. And
finally we come to wun, the seal uv wich wuz a
coat-uv-arms&mdash;bull dog rampant, bowie-knife couchant,
supported by trottin horses, on a field uv green cloth. It wuz from
Hon. John Morrisey, who hed jest ben elected to Congress in Noo
York.</p>
<p>Mr. Morrisey remarked that, ez one uv the pillars uv the
Democrasy, he felt he hed a rite to speek. He wished it to be
understood that he washed his hands uv any connection with Johnson
or his party. He hed seed a lite. In States where the Democrasy, uv
wich he wuz a piller, hed tied themselves to Johnson, they hed gone
down to a prematoor grave. Respeck for the high offis restrained
him from sayin that the Democrasy coodent carry sich a cussid load;
but he wood say that the result uv the election in Noo York, where
they dependid solely on muscle and nigger, wich is the reel
Democratic capital, and succeeded, while where the Democrasy wuz
loaded down with Johnsonianism, they failed, satisfied him that the
President wuz a inkubus. He sed this with all doo respeck for the
offis. Mr. Morrisey further remarked that he hed also personel
reasons for makin this request. He commenced in a humble position,
and hed filled the public eye long enuff to satisfy his modist
ambishen. He hed walloped Sullivan <span class="pagenum"><a id=
"page282" name="page282"></a>282</span>and Heenan; he hed owned the
fastest horses, and won more money at faro than any man in Amerika.
His ambishen wuz satisfied, so fur ez he wuz concerned; but he
hoped to leave behind him, for his infant son (wich wuz only twelve
years uv age, and wich hed a development uv intelleck and muscle
remarkable for one so tender, havin already walloped every boy in
the skool to wich he wuz a goin), he desired to leave that son a
honorable name. It hed bin given out that he wuz a supporter uv the
individooal who okkepied the Presidenshel offis, and it wuz
injoorin him. He wished that stigma removed. A <span class=
"sc">regard for his reputashen</span> forced him to insist upon
it.</p>
<p>And this epistle wuz dooly signed,</p>
<p class="signature"><span class=
"move_left">his&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><br />
<span class="sc">John &times; Morrissey, M.C.</span><br />
<span class="move_left">mark.</span></p>
<p>There wuz silence in the Cabinet. This last stroke intensified
the gloom wich hed settled onto the Government; and ez I turned my
tear-bedewed eyes, I saw the great drops coursin down the cheeks uv
every one present. Mr. Seward retired without sayin anythin about
ninety days, and one by one they all departed.</p>
<p>It wuz a solemn time. There wuz other letters <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page283" name="page283"></a>283</span>yet to be
read, but no one hed the heart to open em. I made a move in that
direckshun, but Androo prevented me. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sick,&rdquo;
murmured he, in a husky voice, which showed that his hart wuz
peerced. &ldquo;Help me to bed.&rdquo; I saw the great man bury his
intellectool head beneath the snowy kivrin uv his oneasy couch, all
but the nose, which in him is the thermometer uv the sole, and
which accordinly glowed, not with the yoosooal brilliant hue, but
with a dull, dead, and ghastly bloo. Noticin the convulsive heavins
uv the kivers, which betrayed the agitashen uv the breast beneath,
I whispered in his ear, ez I handed him his nite drink uv rye
whisky flavored with bourbon, that he hed one hold, ez Delaware hed
sustained him. A flush uv satisfaction passed over his nose, but it
subsided in an instant. &ldquo;Troo,&rdquo; gasped he,
&ldquo;it&rsquo;s ourn now; but before the next election a couple
uv them Massachoosits ablishnists will buy the cussid State, and
re-people it to soot em;&rdquo; and he gave a convulsive gasp, and
sank into a troubled slumber.</p>

<p>When the news uv the result of the Illinoy election reached the
Corners, there wuz a feelin uv oneasiness wich was trooly affectin;
but when the crushin intelligence arove that Hoffman wuz beeten in
Noo York, there wuz a prostration wich wuz only ekalled when the
intelligence of Lee&rsquo;s surrender reached us. We expected
defeat in Illinoy, and some uv the other States, but we hed hopes
that Noo York wood go Dimocratic, that His Eggslency mite hev some
show uv backin by the people, and consekently some excoose for
continyooin to enforce his policy. But that hope wuz taken from us,
and uv the entire populashen, I wuz the only one who hed suffishent
stamina to preserve <span class="pagenum"><a id="page285" name=
"page285"></a>285</span>the semblance uv cheerfulness, and that wuz
only on akkount uv my hevin the Post Offis. Elections can&rsquo;t
take that from me: it is a rock wich the waves uv popler
indignashen can&rsquo;t wash away, thank the Lord! for ef they
cood, how many uv us wood to-day be holdin our places? Still, I
felt overwhelmed, and sorrowfully I entered Bascom&rsquo;s. There,
with their heads bowed in sorrer, and tears flowin from their
venrable eyes, sot Deekin Pogram, Elder Slathers, and a few others
uv the Saints, who, ez I entered, mekanikally rose, and stood afore
the bar; mekanikally Bascom, who wuz likewise bowed down with
greef, sot out the invigorator; mekanikally we dosed ourselves, and
still in a daze, mekanikally I moved out without payin, Bascom bein
too full uv sorrer to notis it.</p>
<p>It wuz deemed proper, in view uv the great calamity, that
services shood be held in the church, and at 2 P.M., wich with us
mite be sed to mean post mortem, we slowly and sadly filed in, the
only smilin countenance in site bein that uv a nigger at the door,
who wuz to-wunst beltid over the head for lookin happy.</p>
<p>I gave out the hymn,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Broad is the road wich leeds to death,&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page286" name=
"page286"></a>286</span>and it wuz sung with tetchin pathos. After
the weepin hed subsided, and I got my feelings calmed down so ez to
permit me to speek, I commenst explainin to em the causes uv the
result. It wuz, I sed, a chastenin sent onto us for our sins; a
stripin becoz we hed exalted our horn in our pride; that, gloryin
in the possession uv the post offices, the collectorships, the
assessorships, and sich, we hed become vain-glorious and puffed up,
and careless in performance uv dooties. Ther wuz niggers in
Kentucky a goin about free, and impiously settin at naught the
decrees uv Providence, wich condemned em to be servants uv their
brethren; and heer I digressed to eloocydate a pint. I hed seen
stricters in a Boston paper onto the common practice uv
amalgamashen in the South, wich paper held up the practis to the
condemnashen uv pious men. &ldquo;My brethren,&rdquo; sed I,
&ldquo;them Boston Ablishnists hev no cleer understandin uv the
Skripter. When Ham wuz cust by Noar, wat wuz that cuss?
&lsquo;<em>He shel be a servant unto his brethren.</em>&rsquo; Not
unto strangers; not unto the Philistine, or the Girgeshite, or the
Millerite, but unto his brethren! How cood he be servant unto his
brethren except thro amalgamashen? Onless we amalgamated with em,
how wood the male niggers be our brethren? O, my <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page287" name="page287"></a>287</span>brethren! we
wuz obliged to do these things, that the Skripters mite be
fulfilled; and to the credit uv the Southern people, be it sed,
that they never shrunk from the performance uv dooty. The per cent.
uv yeller niggers in this State attests how faithful Kentucky hez
bin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But to resoom. We hev sinned in permittin skools to come in, and
unfit um for their normal and skriptural condishen; but these is
not all. My brethren, go to Esq. McGavitt&rsquo;s, and get the
township Bible, and search till yoo find this yer tex:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;And no man puttith new wine into old bottles, else the
new wine doth bust the bottles, and the wine is spilled.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My brethren, wich is the bottles? The Dimocrisey, uv course; and
the most uv em may be considered old ones. We hev actid as bottles,
carrying about flooids&mdash;not percisely wine, but the modern
substitoot therefor&mdash;from our earliest infancy. Wich is new
wine? The Ablishnists wich follered Johnson, uv course. New wine is
frothy; so wuz they. New wine fizzes; so did they. New wine hez
strength for a minnit; so hed they. New wine is unreliable; so wuz
they. At Philadelphy the puttin uv this new wine into old bottles
wuz accomplished; at that accursed place anshent Dimocrisy,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page288" name=
"page288"></a>288</span>wich beleeves in Ham and Hagar, met and
fell onto the nex uv Seward and Doolittle, wich invented
Ablishinism, and we mingled our teers together; the new wine wuz
put into the venerable old bottle uv Dimocrisy, and notwithstandin
we hooped it with Federal patronage, it busted, and great wuz the
bust thereof; and the fragments uv the bottles wuz prone onto the
earth, and the new wine is runnin round permiscus. So wuz the
Skripter fulfilled.</p>
<p>And, my brethren, while yoo are at the Squire&rsquo;s huntin up
that tex, keep on till yoo find another, to wit:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;No man also seweth a piece uv old cloth onto a new
garment, else the new piece that filleth it up taketh it away from
the old, and the rent is made worse.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My hearers, Democrisy went to Philadelphy in a soot uv gray,
wich it hed bin a wearin for five years. It wuz trooly old, and
ther wuz greevious rents in it, made mostly by bayonets, and sich.
O, why wuzn&rsquo;t we content to wear it? Why wuz we not satisfied
with it? Agin wuz the Skripters fulfilled. We patched up the
Confedrit gray with Federal blue; we put onto the back, Seward;
onto the knees, Randall; onto the shoulders, Cowan; and onto the
seat, Johnson, and they wuz stitched <span class="pagenum"><a id=
"page289" name="page289"></a>289</span>together with Post Offisis.
But it didn&rsquo;t hold. The Skripters wuz fulfilled; the old
cloth wuz rotten, and one by one patches fell off, somewhat
dirtied, and takin with em a part uv the old, and the rents is
bigger than before. Our coat is busted at the elbows, our pants is
frayed round the bottoms, out at the knees, and from behind the
flag uv distress waveth drearily in the cold wind.</p>
<p>My brethren, we will succeed when we stick to our integrity. Wat
wuz the yoose uv our assoomin what we did not hev? Wat wuz the
sence uv our askin our people to vote for Kernels for Congris wich
hed, doorin the war, drafted their sons? Wat wuz the yoose uv
talking Constooshnel Amendments to men who spozed that Internal
Improvements and a Nashnel Bank wuz still the ishoo? Wat wuz the
yoose uv lettin go our holt on nigger equality, wich is the right
bower, left bower, and ace uv the Democrisy,&mdash;its tower uv
strength, its anker and cheefest trust, and wich is easy uv
comprehension, and eminently adapted to the Democratic
intelleck,&mdash;and takin up questions wich will all be settled
ten years afore they begin to comprehend em? In breef, wat wuz the
sense, my brethren, in puttin new wine into old bottles?&mdash;uv
patchin old cloth with new? Let us be warned; and never repeet the
fatle error.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page290" name=
"page290"></a>290</span>The congregashen dispersed somewhat sadly,
but ez they gathered at Bascom&rsquo;s to discuss the sermon, I wuz
gratified at observin a visible improvement in their temper. Bascom
hisself bussled around lively; Deekin Pogram remarked that probably
it wuz unskriptooral to put new wine into old tubs, but ez he
didn&rsquo;t hev an ijee; that the prohibishen extendid to new
whisky, he&rsquo;d resk it, bust or no bust, and he pizened hisself
very much in the old style, and Elder Slather and Kernel McPelter
so far recovered their sperits ez to hang the nigger I menshend in
the beginnin ez lookin pleased at the church. The Corners is
rapidly gettin itself agin.</p>

November 19, 1866.</p>
<p>Poets hev remarked a great many times, too tejus to enoomerate,
that &ldquo;farewell&rdquo; is the saddistist word to pronounce
wich hez to be pronounst. It may be so among poets, wich are spozd
to be a continyooally carryin about with em a load uv sadnis, and
sensibilities, and sich; but I hev never found it so. The fact is,
it depends very much on how yoo say it, under wat circumstances,
and to whom. Wen, in my infancy, I wuz inkarseratid in the common
jail uv my native village, in Noo Gersey, a victim to the
prejudisis uv twelve men, who believed, on the unsupportid
testimony uv three men, and the mere accident uv the missin
property bein found in my possession (notwithstandin <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page292" name="page292"></a>292</span>the fact
that I solemnly asshoored em that I didn&rsquo;t know nothin about
it, and if I did it, it must hev bin in a somnamboolic state), that
I hed bin guilty uv bustin open a grosery store, and takin twelve
boxes uv cheroot cigars, I asshoor yoo that, at the end uv the
sentence,&mdash;hevin bin fed on bread and water,&mdash;the sayin
of farewell to the inhuman jailer wuzn&rsquo;t at all onpleasant.
Likewise, when, in the State uv Pennsylvany, in the eggscitin
campane uv 1856, I votid twict or four times for that eminent and
gilelis patriot, Jeems Bookannon, and wuz hauled up therefor, and
sentenced by a Ablishn Judge to a year in the Western Penitentiary,
after an elokent speech, in wich I reviewed the whole question at
issue between the parties, and ashoored him that my triflin
irregularity in the matter uv votin grew out uv an overweenin
desire for the salvashen uv my beloved country,&mdash;that, feelin
that rooin wuz ahead uv us, onless that leveler Fremont wuz
defeated, I felt that my conshence wood not be easy onless I did
all in my power to ayert the evil,&mdash;when I emerged from them
gloomy walls, with one soot uv close, and a tolable knowledge uv
the shoemakin biznis, wuz it a sad thing for me to say
&ldquo;Farewell&rdquo; to the grim jailer, whose key turned
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page293" name=
"page293"></a>293</span>one way wuz liberty, and tother way
captivity? Nary.</p>
<p>These two instances, I beleeve, is the only ones in wich I hev
ever hed to say farewell. In the course uv my long and checkered
career (I do not here allood to the style uv clothin in the
Penitentiary), I am, when I think uv it, surprised at the
comparatively few times wich I ever left a place at wich I hed bin
stayin, in daylite! I ginerally went in the nite,&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>&ldquo;Foldin my tent like the Arab,</p>
<p class="i2">And ez silently steelin away,&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>hevin too much sensibility to be an onwillin witnis uv the agony
uv landladies, when they diskivered that I cood not pay. Knowin the
softnis uv my heart, I hev alluz hed a great regard for my
feelins.</p>
<p>Still, I feel some disinclinashen to commence sayin Farewell at
this time. I wood like to continyoo this work. Methinks I wood like
to go on pilin up pages ontil the Dimocrisy uv the Yoonited States
wuz thoroughly indoctrinatid with <em>my</em> Dimocrisy. But it is
impossible.</p>
<p>I bid my readers farewell in a period uv gloom rarely ekalled,
and never surpast, for the Democrisy. Never in my recollekshun wuz
the party in sich a state uv abject cussitood. The Northern States
hev <span class="pagenum"><a id="page294" name=
"page294"></a>294</span>slipt from our grasp one by one, ontil none
remains wich we kin fondly call ourn. The Border States are losin
their Dimocrisy, and rallyin under the black banner uv Ablishinism;
and the ten States which we kin control onfortinitly ain&rsquo;t
got no voice in the Guvment. From the mountin tops uv Maine, and
the level pararies uv Illinoy, the remnants uv the Dimocrisy holler
to us uv the South, &ldquo;Be firm! we&rsquo;ll stand by
yoo!&rdquo; and from the rich cotton fields uv the South the
Dimocrisy holler to them uv the North, &ldquo;Keep up yoor sperits!
we are troo to yoo!&rdquo; all uv wich is very cheerin, when them
uv the North is in sich a hopelis minority ez to be unable to elect
a township constable, and them in the South hain&rsquo;t got no
vote at all!</p>
<p>I appeal, however, with the rest uv the leaders, to the
Dimocrisy to remain firm. Suthin will come in time,&mdash;what, I
can&rsquo;t, with any degree uv certinty, now state; but suthin
will come. The Ablishnists cannot alluz rool. The cuss uv the old
Whig party wuz, that the respective individooal members thereof
cood read and write, and hed a knack uv doin their own thinkin, and
therefore it cood not be brot into that state uv dissipline so
nessary to success ez a party. That same cuss is a hangin onto the
Ablishnists. They hung together from 1856 to 1860 <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page295" name="page295"></a>295</span>coz there
wuz wat they called a prinsipple at stake; and on that prinsipple
they elected Linkin. They wood hev fallen to peeces then, but our
Southern brethren decided to commence operashens for the new
goverment it hed so long desired; and the overwhelmin pressur uv
the war smothered all miner ishoos and all individooal feelin, and
they hung together long enough to see that throo. Now, still for
the principle wich welded em doorin the war, they are holdin
together yit, and probably will ontil they think this question wich
they are disposin of is disposed of. Then they will split up, and
our openin is made. We hev a solid phalanx, wich they can&rsquo;t
win over or detach from us. We hev them old veterans who voted for
Jaxon, and who are still votin for him. We hev them sturdy old
yeomanry who still swear that Bloo Lite Fedralism ought to be put
down, and can&rsquo;t be tolerated in a Republikin Goverment, and
who, bless their old souls! don&rsquo;t know no more what Bloo Lite
Fedralism wuz than an unborn baby does uv Guy Fawkes. We hev that
solid army uv voters whose knees yawn hidjusly, and whose coats is
out at elbows, and whose children go barefoot in winter, while
their dads is a drinkin cheap whiskey, and damin the Goverment for
imposin a income tax. We hev the patriotic <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page296" name="page296"></a>296</span>citizins
whose noses blossom like the lobster, and who live in mortal fear
uv nigger ekality; and we hev John Morrissey&rsquo;s
constitooents.</p>
<p>These classes argyment won&rsquo;t move, and reasonin
won&rsquo;t faze. They like to abooze the Goverment for levyin
taxes, hopin to deseeve somebody into the idea that they pay taxes,
and that it bears hard onto em; and they oppose nigger ekality
becoz it soothes em, like laudnum, to think that there is somebody
in the country lower down than themselves. The Dimocrisy alluz hed
these, and alluz will.</p>
<p>Ez I remarked, the Ablishnists, when releeved uv the pressure
now bearin onto em, will grow fractious, and split, and these
classes will hev no trouble to git into a majority, and then our
time comes.</p>
<p>The discouraged Dimokrat may say that preechers, and
noosepapers, and Sundy skools, and sich, are underminin their
party. In time they will, but not yet. There is still whisky in the
land, and the nigger is not yet extinct. Uv wat danger is preechers
to these men, when yoo coodent git one uv em within gun-shot uv
one? and wat harm is noosepapers to em, when they can&rsquo;t read?
Besides, we are not at the end uv our resources yet. When the wust
comes to the wust, there is the nigger left us. When he is no
longer uv use to us ez he is now,&mdash;when <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page297" name="page297"></a>297</span>the
prejoodis is so far removed ez to invest him with the
suffrage,&mdash;then <span class="sc">we&rsquo;ll</span> give him
the ballot,&mdash;<span class="sc">we&rsquo;ll</span> lead him up
out uv Egypt, and we&rsquo;ll make him vote with us. The Dimocrisy
never yet failed to control all uv the lower orders uv sosiety.
They hev the lowest grade uv the furriners; they hev Delaware and
Maryland; they hev Noo York city and Suthern Illinoy; and ef the
nigger gets the ballot afore he does the spellin-book, he&rsquo;s
ourn beyond peradvencher.</p>
<p>Again: Ef our politikel stumiks isn&rsquo;t yet toned up to
swallerin the nigger, we kin compermise on the Mexican. That
country Johnson hez his eagle eye on now, and ef we demand it,
he&rsquo;ll take it. Wat a glorious prospeck opens to us! Mexico
wood cut up into at least twenty States, wich, added to the ten we
hev, wood make a clean majority wich we cood hold for years.
Massachoosets cood do nuthin in Mexico. The Greasers ain&rsquo;t
adapted to Massachoosets. Ef they sent their long-haired teachers
there with their spellin books, they&rsquo;d end their labors by
lettin a knife into their intestines for the clothes they wore,
wich wood put a check on the mishnary biznis. They are, it is troo,
several degrees lower in the skale uv humanity than the niggers,
but then they ain&rsquo;t niggers, and we cood marry <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page298" name="page298"></a>298</span>em without
feelin that we&rsquo;d degraded ourselves. Ther is undoubtedly
cusses on em, but the only cuss we hev Constooshnel objections to
is the cuss uv Ham, and that they ain&rsquo;t labrin under. Mexico
affords us room for hope; we never shel run out uv material for
Dimocratic votes until she is convertid, and but few mishnaries
wood hev the nerve to tackle her.</p>
<p>Therfore I say to the Dimocrisy, be uv good cheer! Ther&rsquo;s
a brite day a dawnin. We hev now the Post Offisis, and nothin short
uv an impeachment kin take em from us for two years. We may be
beaten in 1868; it may be that our managin men promised the
nominashen to our present Head&mdash;<span class="sc">A.

console ourselves with the reflection that we&rsquo;re yoost to it,
and we kin go on hopin for the good time that must come.</p>
<p>Let us hold onto our faith, and continyoo to run, hopin
eventooally to be glorified. Let us remember that all the
majorities agin us don&rsquo;t change the fact that Noah cust Ham,
and that Hagar wuz sent back to her mistress. Let us remember that
Paul, or some one uv them possels, remarked, &ldquo;Servance, obey
yoor masters,&rdquo; and that, under Ablishn rool, we are exposed
to the danger uv marryin niggers. <span class="pagenum"><a id=

faith that evenchooally, when reason returns, the Amerikin people
will not throw away the boon we offer em uv fillin the cuss uv
labor imposed by the Almity for disobedience in the garden, ez the
Dimocrisy served in the army, by substitoot, and persevere even
unto the perfeck end. When this good time is come, then will the
anshent Dimocrisy, uv wich I hev bin to-wunst a piller and a
ornament for thirty years, triumph, and the position wich I now
hold, wich is rather too temporary to be agreeable, be continyood
unto me for keeps, and layin off the armor uv actooal warfare, I

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be

copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with

keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check

before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
